    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Polar auxin transport controls multiple developmental processes in plants, including the formation of vascular tissue. Mutations affecting the PIN-FORMED (PIN1) gene diminish polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence axes. The AtPIN1gene was found to encode a 67-kilodalton protein with similarity to bacterial and eukaryotic carrier proteins, and the AtPIN1 protein was detected at the basal end of auxin transport-competent cells in vascular tissue. AtPIN1 may act as a transmembrane component of the auxin efflux carrier.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>To test the hypothesis that auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) is a receptor controlling auxin-mediated plant cell expansion, ABP1 complementary DNAs were expressed in a controllable fashion in tobacco plants and constitutively in maize cell lines. Induction of Arabidopsis ABP1 expression in tobacco leaf strips resulted in an increased capacity for auxin-mediated cell expansion, whereas induction of ABP1 in intact plants resulted in leaves with a normal morphology, but larger cells. Similarly, constitutive expression of maize ABP1 in maize cell lines conferred on them the capacity to respond to auxin by increasing cell size. These results support a role of ABP1 as an auxin receptor controlling plant growth.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant hormone auxin activates many early response genes that are thought to be responsible for diverse aspects of plant growth and development. It has been proposed that auxin signal transduction is mediated by a conserved signalling cascade consisting of three protein kinases: the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). Here we show that a specific plant MAPKKK, NPK1, activates a MAPK cascade that leads to the suppression of early auxin response gene transcription. A mutation in the kinase domain abolishes NPK1 activity, and the presence of the carboxy-terminal domain diminishes the kinase activity. Moreover, the effects of NPK1 on the activation of a MAPK and the repression of early auxin response gene transcription are specifically eliminated by a MAPK phosphatase. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the NPK1 kinase domain produced seeds defective in embryo and endosperm development. These results suggest that auxin sensitivity may be balanced by antagonistic signalling pathways that use a distinct MAPK cascade in higher plants.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The AXR1 (auxin-resistant) protein, which has features of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, is required for normal response to the plant hormone auxin in Arabidopsis thaliana. ECR1 functions together with AXR1 to activate members of the RUB/NEDD8 family of ubiquitin-related proteins. Extracts from mutant seedlings lacking AXR1 did not promote formation of the RUB-ECR1 thiolester, indicating that AXR1 is the major activity in this tissue. AXR1 was localized primarily to the nucleus of dividing and elongating cells, suggesting that the targets of RUB modification are nuclear. These results indicate that auxin response depends on RUB modification of one or more nuclear proteins.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Transcription of the AUX/IAA family of genes is rapidly induced by the plant hormone auxin, but evidence that AUX/IAA genes mediate further responses to auxin has been elusive. Changes in diverse auxin responses result from mutations in the Arabidopsis AXR3 gene. AXR3 was shown to be a member of the AUX/IAA family, providing direct evidence that AUX/IAA genes are central in auxin signaling. Molecular characterization of axr3 gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations established the functional importance of domains conserved among AUX/IAA proteins.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Cyclic AMP is an important signalling molecule in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but its significance in higher plants has been generally doubted because they have low adenylyl cyclase activity and barely detectable amounts of cAMP. Here we used activation T-DNA tagging to create tobacco cell lines that can proliferate in the absence of the phytohormone auxin in the culture media. The sequence tagged in one line, axi 141, was used to isolate a complementary DNA encoding adenylyl cyclase, the first from a higher plant. Sequence analysis reveals that the tobacco adenylyl cyclase is probably soluble, contains characteristic leucine-rich repeats, and bears similarity with adenylyl cyclase from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli results in an increase in endogenous cAMP levels, and in yeast its expression functionally complements the cry1 mutation. Tobacco protoplasts treated with cAMP, or the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, no longer require auxin to divide. This finding, together with the observation that the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor dideoxyadenosine inhibits cell proliferation in the presence of auxin, suggests that cAMP is involved in auxin-triggered cell division in higher plants.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant hormone auxin regulates plant physiology by modulating the interaction of transcription factors with auxin response elements (AuxREs) of the affected genes. A transcription factor, Auxin Response Factor 1 (ARF1), that binds to the sequence TGTCTC in AuxREs was cloned from Arabidopsis by using a yeast one-hybrid system. ARF1 has an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain related to the carboxyl terminus of the maize transactivator Viviparous-1. Sequence requirements for ARF1 binding in vitro are identical to those that confer auxin responsiveness in vivo. The carboxyl terminus of ARF1 contains two motifs found in the Aux/IAA class of proteins and appears to mediate protein-protein interactions.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant hormone auxin regulates various developmental processes including root formation, vascular development, and gravitropism. Mutations within the AUX1 gene confer an auxin-resistant root growth phenotype and abolish root gravitropic curvature. Polypeptide sequence similarity to amino acid permeases suggests that AUX1 mediates the transport of an amino acid-like signaling molecule. Indole-3-acetic acid, the major form of auxin in higher plants, is structurally similar to tryptophan and is a likely substrate for the AUX1 gene product. The cloned AUX1 gene can restore the auxin-responsiveness of transgenic aux1 roots. Spatially, AUX1 is expressed in root apical tissues that regulate root gravitropic curvature.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Bending in plant tissues results from differential cell elongation. We have characterized Arabidopsis "hookless" mutants that are defective in differential growth in the hypocotyl. HOOKLESS1 was cloned and its predicted protein shows similarity to a diverse group of N-acetyltransferases. HOOKLESS1 mRNA is increased by treatment with ethylene and decreased in the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2. High level expression of HOOKLESS1 mRNA results in constitutive hook curvature. The morphology of the hookless hypocotyl is phenocopied by inhibitors of auxin transport or by high levels of endogenous or exogenous auxin. Spatial patterns of expression of two immediate early auxin-responsive genes are altered in hookless1 mutants, suggesting that the ethylene response gene HOOKLESS1 controls differential cell growth by regulating auxin activity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Tumours are induced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens on a variety of plants. The virulence determinants of A. tumefaciens reside on a large tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid. This plasmid carries two regions essential for tumour induction, namely the T region and the Vir region. During infection the T region is transferred to the plant cell, where it becomes stably integrated in one of the host chromosomes as T-DNA. Expression of T-DNA leads to the production of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin, as well as to the synthesis of specific amino-acid derivatives termed opines. Agrobacterium strains are classified according to the types of opines produced by the tumours they induce. The Vir region contains genes that are expressed in the bacterium and are required for T-DNA transfer to plant cells, and several other genes that affect the efficiency of transfer and the host range. Vir regions from different Ti plasmids may vary slightly in the genes they contain: for instance, the virF gene, which is present in the Vir-region of octopine Ti plasmids, is absent from nopaline Ti plasmids. Mutation of the virF gene leads to a weakened virulence of octopine strains on tomato and Nicotiana glauca (shrub tobacco). Nopaline strains are strongly attenuated in N. glauca compared with octopine strains because of the absence of the virF virulence gene from the Ti plasmid in nopaline strains. The virF gene product may be transferred to and be active in plant cells. Here we isolate transgenic N. glauca plants in which the virF coding sequence is expressed using the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The presence of the VirF protein converts the non-host N. glauca into a host for tumour formation by A. tumefaciens nopaline strains and octopine virF mutants. Our results indicate that certain virulence gene products such as the VirF protein may be transferred to plant cells during tumour induction, where they function as mediators of T-DNA transfer.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant hormone auxin has a central role in many aspects of plant growth and development. By screening for mutants of Arabidopsis that are resistant to exogenous auxin, we have identified several genes that are required for normal auxin response. One of these genes, AXR1, is defined by recessive mutations that confer auxin resistance to the roots, rosettes and inflorescences of mutant plants. In addition, axr1 mutants display a variety of morphological defects that are consistent with a reduction in auxin sensitivity. Here we isolate the AXR1 gene using a map-based approach and report that AXR1 encodes a new protein with significant sequence similarity to the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. The AXR1 protein is highly diverged from previously characterized E1 enzymes, however, and lacks a key cysteine residue that is essential for E1 activity. AXR1 may therefore define a new class of enzymes in the ubiquitin pathway or it may have a novel function in cellular regulation which is unrelated to ubiquitin conjugation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Mutant Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain A66 is shown to differ from its wild-type progenitor (strain A6) by a spontaneous 2.7 kb DNA insert into the T-DNA region of its Ti plasmid. Tobacco stems transformed by A66 exhibit an attenuated response characterized by slow growth and shoot proliferation. Clonal analysis demonstrates that this response is due to an alteration in the growth and regenerative potential of transformed cells, rather than to variation in the frequency of fully autonomous cells within the primary tumor. Cloned A66 transformed tobacco cells exhibit an auxin requirement for growth that can be overcome by shoot proliferation. Other host species, however, may complement the A66 mutation yielding fully auxin-independent tumors when transformed by this bacterium.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Symmetric application of indole-3-acetic acid, CO(2), or, to a lesser extent, ethylene can substitute for the contact stimulus in inducing coiling in the tendrils of Marah fabaceus. In the case of auxin, treatment of the apical few millimeters results in strong, permanent coiling throughout the length of the tendril. The speed of the response to CO(2) is comparable to that to tactile stimuli. A possible mechanism for thigmotropism is outlined.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Ethylene at low concentrations inhibits the light-induced opening of the bean hypocotyl hook; auxin inhibits the opening by inducing production of ethylene. Light causes a decrease in ethylene production and an increase in the production of carbon dioxide. Hook opening appears to be a response in which ethylene serves as a natural growth regulator and in which carbon dioxide may be involved also as a growth regulator through its antagonism of the action of ethylene.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Extracts of etiolated pea seedlings oxidize indole-3-acetic acid, a plant auxin, to 3-hydroxymethyloxindole. At physiological pH this compound is dehydrated to 3-methyleneoxindole, a highly reactive sulfhydryl reagent and inhibitor of cell growth. 3-Methlyeneoxindole is in turn detoxified by an enzymatic, triphosphopyridine nucleotide-linked reduction to 3-methyloxindole, a nontoxic compound. These enzymatic conversions may be responsible for some of the responses to auxin, particularly sensitivity to its inhibitory effects on growth.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Aerial sprays of synthetic auxins defoliate many species of tropical trees. Treatment of Euonymus japonica leaves with the n-butyl ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid causes premature senescence and leaf fall and stimulates ethylene production by the blade 5-to 25-fold. Exposure to ethylene alone similarly accelerates senescence and leaf fall. Evidence indicates that the defoliant action of auxin is mediated through the enhanced amounts of ethylene in the blade.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Vernolepin (5 to 50 micrograms per milliliter), a novel sesquiterpenoid dilactone obtained from Vernonia hymenolepis, inhibits extension growth (from 20 to 80 percent) of wheat coleoptile sections. Inhibited tissues appear normal and their respiration is unaffected. If the inhibited sections are washed and subsequently treated with indole-3-acetic acid, the tissues respond to the auxin, but the degree of elongation is determined by the length of prior treatment with vernolepin. Administered simultaneously, increasing concentrations of auxin will significantly reduce the inhibitory effect of vernolepin, but there is no evidence for a competitive interaction between the two substances.</p>

This reversibility makes it unlikely that wall loosening is mediated by enzymes, such as cellulase and beta-glucanase, which degrade polysaccharides, since their action is essentially irreversible.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In our opinion, all of the phenomena that are inhibited by cytochalasin can be thought of as resulting from contractile activity of cellular organelles. Smooth muscle contraction, clot retraction, beat of heart cells, and shortening of the tadpole tail are all cases in which no argument of substance for alternative causes can be offered. The morphogenetic processes in epithelia, contractile ring function during cytokinesis, migration of cells on a substratum, and streaming in plant cells can be explained most simply on the basis of contractility being the causal event in each process. The many similarities between the latter cases and the former ones in which contraction is certain argue for that conclusion. For instance, platelets probably contract, possess a microfilament network, and behave like undulating membrane organelles. Migrating cells possess undulating membranes and contain a similar network. It is very likely, therefore, that their network is also contractile. In all of the cases that have been examined so far, microfilaments of some type are observed in the cells; furthermore, those filaments are at points where contractility could cause the respective phenomenon. The correlations from the cytochalasin experiments greatly strengthen the case; microfilaments are present in control and "recovered" cells and respective biological phenomena take place in such cells; microfilaments are absent or altered in treated cells and the phenomena do not occur. The evidence seems overwhelming that microfilaments are the contractile machinery of nonmuscle cells. The argument is further strengthened if we reconsider the list of processes insensitive to cytochalasin (Table 2). Microtubules and their sidearms, plasma membrane, or synthetic machinery of cells are presumed to be responsible for such processes, and colchicine, membrane-active drugs, or inhibitors of protein synthesis are effective at inhibiting the respective phenomena. These chemical agents would not necessarily be expected to affect contractile apparatuses over short periods of time, they either do not or only secondarily interfere with the processes sensitive to cytochalasin (Table 1). It is particularly noteworthy in this context that microtubules are classed as being insensitive to cytochalasin and so are not considered as members of the "contractile microfilament" family. The overall conclusion is that a broad spectrum of cellular and developmental processes are caused by contractile apparatuses that have at least the common feature of being sensitive to cytochalasin. Schroeder's important insight (3) has, then, led to the use of cytochalasin as a diagnostic tool for such contracile activity: the prediction is that sensitivity to the drug implies presence of some type of contractile microfilament system. Only further work will define the limits of confidence to be placed upon such diagnoses. The basis of contraction in microfilament systems is still hypothetical. Contraction of glycerol-extracted cells in response to adenosine triphosphate (53), extraction of actin-like or actomyosin-like proteins from cells other than muscle cells (54), and identification of activity resembling that of the actomyosin-adenosine triphosphatase system in a variety of nonmuscle tissues (40, 54) are consistent with the idea that portions of the complex, striated muscle contractile system may be present in more primitive contractile machinery. In the case of the egg cortex, calcium-activated contractions can be inhibited by cytochalasin. If, as seems likely, microfilaments are the agents activated by calcium, then it will be clear that they have the same calcium requirement as muscle. Biochemical analyses of primitive contractile systems are difficult to interpret. Ishikawa's important observation (31), that heavy meromyosin complexes with fine filaments oriented parallel to the surface of chondrocytes and perpendicular to the surface of intestinal epithelial cells, implies that both types of filaments are "actin-like" in this one respect. Yet, it is very likely that these actin-like filaments correspond respectively to the cytochalasin-insensitive sheath of glial and heart fibroblasts and the core filaments of oviduct microvilli. No evidence from our studies links contractility directly to these meromyosin-binding filaments. Apart from this problem, activity resembling that of the myosin-adenosine triphosphatase has been associated with the microtubule systems of sperm tails and cilia (55), but those organelles are insensitive to cytochalasin in structure and function. Clearly, a means must be found to distinguish between enzymatic activities associated with microfilament networks, microfilament bundles, microtubules, and the sheath filaments of migratory cells. Until such distinctions are possible, little of substance can be said about the molecular bases of primitive contractile systems. Three variables are important for the control of cellular processes dependent upon microfilaments: (i) which cells of a population shall manufacture and assemble the filaments; (ii) where filaments shall be assembled in cells; and (iii) when contractility shall occur. With respect to distribution among cells, the networks involved in cell locomotion are presumed to be present in all cells that have the potential to move in cell culture. In this respect, the networks can be regarded as a common cellular organelle in the sense that cytoplasmic microtubules are so regarded. In some developing systems, all cells of an epithelium possess microfilament bundles (7, 13), whereas, in others, only discrete subpopulations possess the bundles (5, 6). In these cases the filaments can be regarded as being differentiation products associated only with certain cell types. These considerations may be related to the fact that microfilament networks are associated with behavior of individual cells (such as migration, wound healing, and cytokinesis), whereas the bundles are present in cells that participate in coordinated changes in shape of cell populations. With respect to placement in cells, two alternatives are apparent, namely, localized or ubiquitous association with the plasma membrane. Microfilament bundles of epithelial cells are only found extending across the luminal and basal ends of cells. In this respect they contrast with desmosomal tonofilaments and with microtubules, each of which can curve in a variety of directions through the cell. The strict localization of microfilament bundles probably rests upon their association with special junctional complex insertion regions that are only located near the ends of cells. In the case of mitotically active cells, the orientation of the spindle apparatus may determine the site at which the contractile ring of microfilaments will form (4, 56); this raises the question of what sorts of cytoplasmic factors can influence the process of association between filament systems and plasma membranes. In contrast to such cases of localized distribution, contractile networks responsible for cell locomotion are probably found beneath all of the plasma membrane, just as the network of thrombosthenin may extend to all portions of the periphery of a blood platelet. This ubiquitous distribution probably accounts for the ability of a fibroblast or glial cell to establish an undulating membrane at any point on its edge, or of an axon to form lateral microspikes along its length. The third crucial aspect of control of these contractile apparatuses involves the choice of when contraction shall occur (and as a corollary the degree or strength of contraction that will occur). In the simplest situation, contraction would follow automatically upon assembly of the microfilament bundles or networks. In cleavage furrows of marine embryos (4), for instance, microfilaments are seen beneath the central cleavage furrow and at its ends, but not beyond, under the portion of plasma membrane that will subsequently become part of the furrow. This implies that the furrow forms very soon after the contractile filaments are assembled in the egg cortex. In other cases, microfilaments are apparently assembled but not in a state of (maximal?) contraction. Thus, networks are seen along the sides of migratory cells, although such regions are not then active as undulating membrane organelles. Similarly, microfilament bundles occur in all epithelial cells of the salivary gland (13), or pancreatic anlage (7), although only the ones at discrete points are thought to generate morphogenetic tissue movements. Likewise, bundles begin to appear as early as 12 hours after estrogen administration to oviduct, although visible tubular gland formation does not start until 24 to 30 hours. Finally, streaming in plant cells can wax and wane, depending upon external factors such as auxin (57). All of these cases imply a control mechanism other than mere assembly of the microfilament systems and even raise the possibility that within one cell some filaments may be contracting while others are not. In discussing this problem, it must be emphasized that different degrees of contraction or relaxation cannot as yet be recognized with the electron microscope. In fact, every one of the cases cited above could be explained by contraction following immediately upon some subtle sort of "assembly." Inclusive in the latter term are relations between individual filaments, relations of the filaments and their insertion points on plasma membrane, and quantitative alterations in filament systems. Furthermore, the critical role of calcium and high-energy compounds in muscle contraction suggest that equivalent factors may be part of primitive, cytochalasinsensitive systems. The finding that calcium-induced contraction in the cortex of eggs is sensitive to cytochalasin strengthens that supposition and emphasizes the importance of compartmentalization of cofactors as a means of controlling microfilaments in cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Dormin (abscisin II), inhibits growth of Lemna minor cultures. At 1 part per million (3.8x10(-6)M), the culture appears nearly completely dormant but can be revived readily by transferring it to fresh medium free of dormin. The cytokinin benzyladenine, but not auxin or gibberellin, will counteract the dormin effect. Quantitative restoration of normal growth by cytokinin, however, can be achieved only if the dormin concentration does not exceed a critical level. Separation, after phenol-detergent extraction, of nucleic acids on methylated albumin kieselguhr columns showed suppression of nucleic acid synthesis by dormin in all fractions. Inhibition of the synthesis of the DNA fraction seems to precede that of RNA. Cytokinins reverse the process. They promote synthesis of all nucleic acid fractions, but again DNA seems to lead. Further work on the interaction of dormin with growth-promoting hormones might be facilitated by adopting the Monod model of allosteric transition, with, for example, DNA polymerase as the protein, dormin as the inhibitor, and cytokinin or other growth promoters as activators.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The transfer of specific Ti (tumor-inducing) plasmid sequences, the T-DNA, from Agrobacterium tumefaciens to a wide range of plants results in the formation of crown gall tumors. These tissues differ from most plant cells in that they can be grown in vitro in the absence of added phytohormones. Here, data are presented that offer an explanation for the auxin-independent phenotype of crown gall tissues. It is shown that crude cell-free extracts prepared from three bacterial species harboring pTiA6 gene 1 could convert L-tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide; control extracts lacking gene 1 could not carry out the reaction. Other reports indicate that the pTiA6 gene 2 product can convert indole-3-acetamide to indole-3-acetic acid, a naturally occurring auxin of plants. It is concluded that the auxin-independent phenotype of crown gall tissue involves the introduction of Ti plasmid sequences encoding a two-step pathway for auxin synthesis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant growth-hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) is involved in regulating such diverse processes as cell elongation, cell division and differentiation. The sequence of events leading to the various phenomena is still poorly understood. Both changes in extra- and intracellular pH (refs 1-4) and selective transcription are known to be induced by auxin. Evidence for auxin receptors at the plasmalemma membrane has been reported, but the signal transduction pathway is not known, for this nor for other plant hormones. In animal cells, hydrolysis of inositolphospholipids is a major mechanism for transmembrane signalling in response to external stimuli such as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, antigens or light (reviewed in refs 8-11). Here we report that auxin can generate transient changes in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and inositol bisphosphate (InsP2) within minutes in Catharanthus roseus cells arrested in G1. These changes are accompanied by a redistribution within the polyphosphoinositide fraction. As the physiological response to auxin addition is to relieve the arrest in G1, we suggest that these effects are an element in the signal transduction of this plant hormone.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plant roots can regenerate after excision of their tip, including the stem cell niche. To determine which developmental program mediates such repair, we applied a combination of lineage tracing, single-cell&#194;&#160;RNA sequencing, and marker analysis to test different models of tissue reassembly. We show that multiple cell types can reconstitute stem cells, demonstrating the latent potential of untreated plant cells. The transcriptome of regenerating cells prior to stem cell activation resembles that of an embryonic root progenitor. Regeneration defects are more severe in embryonic than in adult root mutants. Furthermore, the signaling domains of the hormones auxin and cytokinin mirror their embryonic dynamics and manipulation of both hormones alters the position of new tissues and stem cell niche markers. Our findings suggest that plant root regeneration follows, on a larger scale, the developmental stages of embryonic patterning and is guided by spatial information provided by complementary hormone domains.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant root cap, surrounding the very tip of the growing root, perceives and transmits environmental signals to the inner root tissues. In Arabidopsis thaliana, auxin released by the root cap contributes to the regular spacing of lateral organs along the primary root axis. Here, we show that the periodicity of lateral organ induction is driven by recurrent programmed cell death at the most distal edge of the root cap. We suggest that synchronous bursts of cell death in lateral root cap cells release pulses of auxin to surrounding root tissues, establishing the pattern for lateral root formation. The dynamics of root cap turnover may therefore coordinate primary root growth with root branching in order to optimize the uptake of water and nutrients from the soil.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The root meristem consists of populations of distal and proximal stem cells and an organizing center known as the quiescent center. During embryogenesis, initiation of the root meristem occurs when an asymmetric cell division of the hypophysis forms the distal stem cells and quiescent center. We have identified NO TRANSMITTING TRACT (NTT) and two closely related paralogs as being required for the initiation of the root meristem. All three genes are expressed in the hypophysis, and their expression is dependent on the auxin-signaling pathway. Expression of these genes is necessary for distal stem cell fate within the root meristem, whereas misexpression is sufficient to transform other stem cell populations to a distal stem cell fate in both the embryo and mature roots.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The prominent and evolutionarily ancient role of the plant hormone auxin is the regulation of cell expansion. Cell expansion requires ordered arrangement of the cytoskeleton but molecular mechanisms underlying its regulation by signalling molecules including auxin are unknown. Here we show in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that in elongating cells exogenous application of auxin or redistribution of endogenous auxin induces very rapid microtubule re-orientation from transverse to longitudinal, coherent with the inhibition of cell expansion. This fast auxin effect requires auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1) and involves a contribution of downstream signalling components such as ROP6 GTPase, ROP-interactive protein RIC1 and the microtubule-severing protein katanin. These components are required for rapid auxin- and ABP1-mediated re-orientation of microtubules to regulate cell elongation in roots and dark-grown hypocotyls as well as asymmetric growth during gravitropic responses.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>During plant growth, dividing cells in meristems must coordinate transitions from division to expansion and differentiation, thus generating three distinct developmental zones: the meristem, elongation zone and differentiation zone. Simultaneously, plants display tropisms, rapid adjustments of their direction of growth to adapt to environmental conditions. It is unclear how stable zonation is maintained during transient adjustments in growth direction. In Arabidopsis roots, many aspects of zonation are controlled by the phytohormone auxin and auxin-induced PLETHORA (PLT) transcription factors, both of which display a graded distribution with a maximum near the root tip. In addition, auxin is also pivotal for tropic responses. Here, using an iterative experimental and computational approach, we show how an interplay between auxin and PLTs controls zonation and gravitropism. We find that the PLT gradient is not a direct, proportionate readout of the auxin gradient. Rather, prolonged high auxin levels generate a narrow PLT transcription domain from which a gradient of PLT protein is subsequently generated through slow growth dilution and cell-to-cell movement. The resulting PLT levels define the location of developmental zones. In addition to slowly promoting PLT transcription, auxin also rapidly influences division, expansion and differentiation rates. We demonstrate how this specific regulatory design in which auxin cooperates with PLTs through different mechanisms and on different timescales enables both the fast tropic environmental responses and stable zonation dynamics necessary for coordinated cell differentiation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Coordination of cell division and pattern formation is central to tissue and organ development, particularly in plants where walls prevent cell migration. Auxin and cytokinin are both critical for division and patterning, but it is unknown how these hormones converge upon tissue development. We identify a genetic network that reinforces an early embryonic bias in auxin distribution to create a local, nonresponding cytokinin source within the root vascular tissue. Experimental and theoretical evidence shows that these cells act as a tissue organizer by positioning the domain of oriented cell divisions. We further demonstrate that the auxin-cytokinin interaction acts as a spatial incoherent feed-forward loop, which is essential to generate distinct hormonal response zones, thus establishing a stable pattern within a growing vascular tissue.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains containing tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmids incite cancerous growths called crown galls when inoculated into wounded dicotyledonous plants. Tumour tissue can be cultured axenically in vitro, and exhibits a transformed phenotype in the absence of the inciting bacterium. Transformed cells grow autonomously, are auxin and cytokinin autotrophic in vitro and synthesize opines, novel amino acid derivatives dictated by Ti plasmid genetic information. A small segment of the Ti plasmid, termed T-DNA is maintained in axenic tumour cells. Mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA from a crown gall teratoma are free from T-DNA, whereas nuclear DNA contains T-DNA in amounts similar to that in total tumour cell DNA. T-DNA appears to be attached to what is presumably plant DNA in the crown gall tumour cell: Southern blot analysis of tumour DNA digested with restriction endonucleases reveals T-DNA fragments that are not fully homologous to Ti plasmid DNA. We report here the isolation by molecular cloning of a 'border fragment' T-DNA and flanking plant DNA from the crown gall teratoma BT37 and show that T-DNA is covalently joined to a repeated DNA element of the tobacco nuclear genome.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1) was discovered nearly 40 years ago and was shown to be essential for plant development and morphogenesis, but its mode of action remains unclear. Here, we report that the plasma membrane-localized transmembrane kinase (TMK) receptor-like kinases interact with ABP1 and transduce auxin signal to activate plasma membrane-associated ROPs [Rho-like guanosine triphosphatases (GTPase) from plants], leading to changes in the cytoskeleton and the shape of leaf pavement cells in Arabidopsis. The interaction between ABP1 and TMK at the cell surface is induced by auxin and requires ABP1 sensing of auxin. These findings show that TMK proteins and ABP1 form a cell surface auxin perception complex that activates ROP signaling pathways, regulating nontranscriptional cytoplasmic responses and associated fundamental processes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Auxin regulates numerous plant developmental processes by controlling gene expression via a family of functionally distinct DNA-binding auxin response factors (ARFs), yet the mechanistic basis for generating specificity in auxin response is unknown. Here, we address this question by solving high-resolution crystal structures of the pivotal Arabidopsis developmental regulator ARF5/MONOPTEROS (MP), its divergent paralog ARF1, and a complex of ARF1 and a generic auxin response DNA element (AuxRE). We show that ARF DNA-binding domains also homodimerize to generate cooperative DNA binding, which is critical for in vivo ARF5/MP function. Strikingly, DNA-contacting residues are conserved between ARFs, and we discover that monomers have the same intrinsic specificity. ARF1 and ARF5 homodimers, however, differ in spacing tolerated between binding sites. Our data identify the DNA-binding domain as an ARF dimerization domain, suggest that ARF dimers bind complex sites as molecular calipers with ARF-specific spacing preference, and provide an atomic-scale mechanistic model for specificity in auxin response.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>How biological systems generate reproducible patterns with high precision is a central question in science. The shoot apical meristem (SAM), a specialized tissue producing plant aerial organs, is a developmental system of choice to address this question. Organs are periodically initiated at the SAM at specific spatial positions and this spatiotemporal pattern defines phyllotaxis. Accumulation of the plant hormone auxin triggers organ initiation, whereas auxin depletion around organs generates inhibitory fields that are thought to be sufficient to maintain these patterns and their dynamics. Here we show that another type of hormone-based inhibitory fields, generated directly downstream of auxin by intercellular movement of the cytokinin signalling inhibitor ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN 6 (AHP6), is involved in regulating phyllotactic patterns. We demonstrate that AHP6-based fields establish patterns of cytokinin signalling in the meristem that contribute to the robustness of phyllotaxis by imposing a temporal sequence on organ initiation. Our findings indicate that not one but two distinct hormone-based fields may be required for achieving temporal precision during formation of reiterative structures at the SAM, thus indicating an original mechanism for providing robustness to a dynamic developmental system.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Recent evidence indicates a correlation between orientation of the plant cortical microtubule cytoskeleton and localization of polar cargoes. However, the molecules and mechanisms that create this correlation have remained unknown. Here we show that, in Arabidopsis thaliana, the microtubule orientation regulators CLASP and MAP65 (refs 3, 4) control the abundance of polarity regulator PINOID kinase at the plasma membrane. By localized upregulation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis at cortical microtubule- and clathrin-rich domains orthogonal to the axis of polarity, PINOID accelerates the removal of auxin transporter PIN proteins from those sites. This mechanism links directional microtubule organization to the polar localization of auxin transporter PIN proteins, and clarifies how microtubule-enriched cell sides are kept distinct from polar delivery domains. Our results identify the molecular machinery that connects microtubule organization to the regulation of the axis of PIN polarization.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In plants, where cells cannot migrate, asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) must be confined to the appropriate spatial context. We investigate tissue-generating asymmetric divisions in a stem cell daughter within the Arabidopsis root. Spatial restriction of these divisions requires physical binding of the stem cell regulator SCARECROW (SCR) by the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) protein. In the stem cell niche, SCR activity is counteracted by phosphorylation of RBR through a cyclinD6;1-CDK complex. This cyclin is itself under transcriptional control of SCR and its partner SHORT ROOT (SHR), creating a robust bistable circuit with either high or low SHR-SCR complex activity. Auxin biases this circuit by promoting CYCD6;1 transcription. Mathematical modeling shows that ACDs are only switched on after integration of radial and longitudinal information, determined by SHR and auxin distribution, respectively. Coupling of cell-cycle progression to protein degradation resets the circuit, resulting in a "flip flop" that constrains asymmetric cell division to the stem cell region.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The phytohormone auxin acts as a prominent signal, providing, by its local accumulation or depletion in selected cells, a spatial and temporal reference for changes in the developmental program. The distribution of auxin depends on both auxin metabolism (biosynthesis, conjugation and degradation) and cellular auxin transport. We identified in silico a novel putative auxin transport facilitator family, called PIN-LIKES (PILS). Here we illustrate that PILS proteins are required for auxin-dependent regulation of plant growth by determining the cellular sensitivity to auxin. PILS proteins regulate intracellular auxin accumulation at the endoplasmic reticulum and thus auxin availability for nuclear auxin signalling. PILS activity affects the level of endogenous auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), presumably via intracellular accumulation and metabolism. Our findings reveal that the transport machinery to compartmentalize auxin within the cell is of an unexpected molecular complexity and demonstrate this compartmentalization to be functionally important for a number of developmental processes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Despite their pivotal role in plant development, control mechanisms for oriented cell divisions have remained elusive. Here, we describe how a precisely regulated cell division orientation switch in an Arabidopsis stem cell is controlled by upstream patterning factors. We show that the stem cell regulatory PLETHORA transcription factors induce division plane reorientation by local activation of auxin signaling, culminating in enhanced expression of the microtubule-associated MAP65 proteins. MAP65 upregulation is sufficient to reorient the cortical microtubular array through a CLASP microtubule-cell cortex interaction mediator-dependent mechanism. CLASP differentially localizes to cell faces in a microtubule- and MAP65-dependent manner. Computational simulations clarify how precise 90&#194;&#176; switches in cell division planes can follow self-organizing properties of the microtubule array in combination with biases in CLASP localization. Our work demonstrates how transcription factor-mediated processes regulate the cellular machinery to control orientation of formative cell divisions in plants.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Auxin is a key plant morphogenetic signal but tools to analyse dynamically its distribution and signalling during development are still limited. Auxin perception directly triggers the degradation of Aux/IAA repressor proteins. Here we describe a novel Aux/IAA-based auxin signalling sensor termed DII-VENUS that was engineered in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The VENUS fast maturing form of yellow fluorescent protein was fused in-frame to the Aux/IAA auxin-interaction domain (termed domain II; DII) and expressed under a constitutive promoter. We initially show that DII-VENUS abundance is dependent on auxin, its TIR1/AFBs co-receptors and proteasome activities. Next, we demonstrate that DII-VENUS provides a map of relative auxin distribution at cellular resolution in different tissues. DII-VENUS is also rapidly degraded in response to auxin and we used it to visualize dynamic changes in cellular auxin distribution successfully during two developmental responses, the root gravitropic response and lateral organ production at the shoot apex. Our results illustrate the value of developing response input sensors such as DII-VENUS to provide high-resolution spatio-temporal information about hormone distribution and response during plant growth and development.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The balance between cellular proliferation and differentiation is a key aspect of development in multicellular organisms. Using high-resolution expression data from the Arabidopsis root, we identified a transcription factor, UPBEAT1 (UPB1), that regulates this balance. Genomewide expression profiling coupled with ChIP-chip analysis revealed that UPB1 directly regulates the expression of a set of peroxidases that modulate the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) between the zones of cell proliferation and the zone of cell elongation where differentiation begins. Disruption of UPB1 activity alters this ROS balance, leading to a delay in the onset of differentiation. Modulation of either ROS balance or peroxidase activity through chemical reagents affects the onset of differentiation in a manner consistent with the postulated UPB1 function. This pathway functions independently of auxin and cytokinin plant hormonal signaling. Comparison to ROS-regulated growth control in animals suggests that a similar mechanism is used in plants and animals.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Spatial distribution of the plant hormone auxin regulates multiple aspects of plant development. These self-regulating auxin gradients are established by the action of PIN auxin transporters, whose activity is regulated by their constitutive cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes. Here, we show that auxin signaling by the auxin receptor AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) inhibits the clathrin-mediated internalization of PIN proteins. ABP1 acts as a positive factor in clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane, thereby promoting endocytosis. Auxin binding to ABP1 interferes with this action and leads to the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Our study demonstrates that ABP1 mediates a nontranscriptional auxin signaling that regulates the evolutionarily conserved process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and suggests that this signaling may be essential for the developmentally important feedback of auxin on its own transport.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Auxin is a multifunctional hormone essential for plant development and pattern formation. A nuclear auxin-signaling system controlling auxin-induced gene expression is well established, but cytoplasmic auxin signaling, as in its coordination of cell polarization, is unexplored. We found a cytoplasmic auxin-signaling mechanism that modulates the interdigitated growth of Arabidopsis leaf epidermal pavement cells (PCs), which develop interdigitated lobes and indentations to form a puzzle-piece shape in a two-dimensional plane. PC interdigitation is compromised in leaves deficient in either auxin biosynthesis or its export mediated by PINFORMED 1 localized at the lobe tip. Auxin coordinately activates two Rho GTPases, ROP2 and ROP6, which promote the formation of complementary lobes and indentations, respectively. Activation of these ROPs by auxin occurs within 30 s and depends on AUXIN-BINDING PROTEIN 1. These findings reveal Rho GTPase-based auxin-signaling mechanisms, which modulate the spatial coordination of cell expansion across a field of cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Stem cells are maintained in the niche by intercellular interactions and signaling networks. In this work, we study extracellular signals required for maintenance of the root stem cell niche in higher plants. We identify a family of functionally redundant homologous peptides that are secreted, tyrosine-sulfated, and expressed mainly in the stem cell area and the innermost layer of central columella cells. We name these peptides root meristem growth factors (RGFs). RGFs are required for maintenance of the root stem cell niche and transit amplifying cell proliferation in Arabidopsis. RGF1 defines expression levels and patterns of the stem cell transcription factor PLETHORA, mainly at the posttranscriptional level. The RGFs function independently of the auxin pathway. These peptide signals play a crucial role in postembryonic root development.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The classic phytohormones cytokinin and auxin play essential roles in the maintenance of stem-cell systems embedded in shoot and root meristems, and exhibit complex functional interactions. Here we show that the activity of both hormones directly converges on the promoters of two A-type ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR) genes, ARR7 and ARR15, which are negative regulators of cytokinin signalling and have important meristematic functions. Whereas ARR7 and ARR15 expression in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is induced by cytokinin, auxin has a negative effect, which is, at least in part, mediated by the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR5/MONOPTEROS (MP) transcription factor. Our results provide a mechanistic framework for hormonal control of the apical stem-cell niche and demonstrate how root and shoot stem-cell systems differ in their response to phytohormones.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Acquisition of cell identity in plants relies strongly on positional information, hence cell-cell communication and inductive signalling are instrumental for developmental patterning. During Arabidopsis embryogenesis, an extra-embryonic cell is specified to become the founder cell of the primary root meristem, hypophysis, in response to signals from adjacent embryonic cells. The auxin-dependent transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) drives hypophysis specification by promoting transport of the hormone auxin from the embryo to the hypophysis precursor. However, auxin accumulation is not sufficient for hypophysis specification, indicating that additional MP-dependent signals are required. Here we describe the microarray-based isolation of MP target genes that mediate signalling from embryo to hypophysis. Of three direct transcriptional target genes, TARGET OF MP 5 (TMO5) and TMO7 encode basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that are expressed in the hypophysis-adjacent embryo cells, and are required and partially sufficient for MP-dependent root initiation. Importantly, the small TMO7 transcription factor moves from its site of synthesis in the embryo to the hypophysis precursor, thus representing a novel MP-dependent intercellular signal in embryonic root specification.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant signalling molecule auxin provides positional information in a variety of developmental processes by means of its differential distribution (gradients) within plant tissues. Thus, cellular auxin levels often determine the developmental output of auxin signalling. Conceptually, transmembrane transport and metabolic processes regulate the steady-state levels of auxin in any given cell. In particular, PIN auxin-efflux-carrier-mediated, directional transport between cells is crucial for generating auxin gradients. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana PIN5, an atypical member of the PIN gene family, encodes a functional auxin transporter that is required for auxin-mediated development. PIN5 does not have a direct role in cell-to-cell transport but regulates intracellular auxin homeostasis and metabolism. PIN5 localizes, unlike other characterized plasma membrane PIN proteins, to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), presumably mediating auxin flow from the cytosol to the lumen of the ER. The ER localization of other PIN5-like transporters (including the moss PIN) indicates that the diversification of PIN protein functions in mediating auxin homeostasis at the ER, and cell-to-cell auxin transport at the plasma membrane, represent an ancient event during the evolution of land plants.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The female reproductive unit of flowering plants, the haploid female gametophyte, is highly reduced relative to other land plants. We show that patterning of the Arabidopsis female gametophyte depends on an asymmetric distribution of the hormone auxin during its syncitial development. Furthermore, this auxin gradient is correlated with location-specific auxin biosynthesis, rather than auxin efflux that directs patterning in the diploid sporophytic tissues comprising the rest of the plant. Manipulation of auxin responses or synthesis induces switching of gametic and nongametic cell identities and specialized nonreproductive cells to exhibit attributes presumptively lost during angiosperm evolution. These findings may account for the unique egg cell specification characteristic of angiosperms and the formation of seeds with single diploid embryos while containing endosperm that can have variable numbers of parental haploid genomes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Local hormone maxima are essential for the development of multicellular structures and organs. For example, steroid hormones accumulate in specific cell types of the animal fetus to induce sexual differentiation and concentration peaks of the plant hormone auxin direct organ initiation and mediate tissue patterning. Here we provide an example of a regulated local hormone minimum required during organogenesis. Our results demonstrate that formation of a local auxin minimum is necessary for specification of the valve margin separation layer where Arabidopsis fruit opening takes place. Consequently, ectopic production of auxin, specifically in valve margin cells, leads to a complete loss of proper cell fate determination. The valve margin identity factor INDEHISCENT (IND) is responsible for forming the auxin minimum by coordinating auxin efflux in separation-layer cells. We propose that the simplicity of formation and maintenance make local hormone minima particularly well suited to specify a small number of cells such as the stripes at the valve margins.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The dynamic, differential distribution of the hormone auxin within plant tissues controls an impressive variety of developmental processes, which tailor plant growth and morphology to environmental conditions. Various environmental and endogenous signals can be integrated into changes in auxin distribution through their effects on local auxin biosynthesis and intercellular auxin transport. Individual cells interpret auxin largely by a nuclear signaling pathway that involves the F box protein TIR1 acting as an auxin receptor. Auxin-dependent TIR1 activity leads to ubiquitination-based degradation of transcriptional repressors and complex transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, auxin appears to be a versatile trigger of preprogrammed developmental changes in plant cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plant growth and development are sustained by meristems. Meristem activity is controlled by auxin and cytokinin, two hormones whose interactions in determining a specific developmental output are still poorly understood. By means of a comprehensive genetic and molecular analysis in Arabidopsis, we show that a primary cytokinin-response transcription factor, ARR1, activates the gene SHY2/IAA3 (SHY2), a repressor of auxin signaling that negatively regulates the PIN auxin transport facilitator genes: thereby, cytokinin causes auxin redistribution, prompting cell differentiation. Conversely, auxin mediates degradation of the SHY2 protein, sustaining PIN activities and cell division. Thus, the cell differentiation and division balance necessary for controlling root meristem size and root growth is the result of the interaction between cytokinin and auxin through a simple regulatory circuit converging on the SHY2 gene.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Gibberellins control a range of growth and developmental processes in higher plants and have been widely used in the agricultural industry. By binding to a nuclear receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1), gibberellins regulate gene expression by promoting degradation of the transcriptional regulator DELLA proteins, including GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE (GAI). The precise manner in which GID1 discriminates and becomes activated by bioactive gibberellins for specific binding to DELLA proteins remains unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of a ternary complex of Arabidopsis thaliana GID1A, a bioactive gibberellin and the amino-terminal DELLA domain of GAI. In this complex, GID1A occludes gibberellin in a deep binding pocket covered by its N-terminal helical switch region, which in turn interacts with the DELLA domain containing DELLA, VHYNP and LExLE motifs. Our results establish a structural model of a plant hormone receptor that is distinct from the mechanism of the hormone perception and effector recognition of the known auxin receptors.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Dynamically polarized membrane proteins define different cell boundaries and have an important role in intercellular communication-a vital feature of multicellular development. Efflux carriers for the signalling molecule auxin from the PIN family are landmarks of cell polarity in plants and have a crucial involvement in auxin distribution-dependent development including embryo patterning, organogenesis and tropisms. Polar PIN localization determines the direction of intercellular auxin flow, yet the mechanisms generating PIN polarity remain unclear. Here we identify an endocytosis-dependent mechanism of PIN polarity generation and analyse its developmental implications. Real-time PIN tracking showed that after synthesis, PINs are initially delivered to the plasma membrane in a non-polar manner and their polarity is established by subsequent endocytic recycling. Interference with PIN endocytosis either by auxin or by manipulation of the Arabidopsis Rab5 GTPase pathway prevents PIN polarization. Failure of PIN polarization transiently alters asymmetric auxin distribution during embryogenesis and increases the local auxin response in apical embryo regions. This results in ectopic expression of auxin pathway-associated root-forming master regulators in embryonic leaves and promotes homeotic transformation of leaves to roots. Our results indicate a two-step mechanism for the generation of PIN polar localization and the essential role of endocytosis in this process. It also highlights the link between endocytosis-dependent polarity of individual cells and auxin distribution-dependent cell fate establishment for multicellular patterning.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Shoot branching is a major determinant of plant architecture and is highly regulated by endogenous and environmental cues. Two classes of hormones, auxin and cytokinin, have long been known to have an important involvement in controlling shoot branching. Previous studies using a series of mutants with enhanced shoot branching suggested the existence of a third class of hormone(s) that is derived from carotenoids, but its chemical identity has been unknown. Here we show that levels of strigolactones, a group of terpenoid lactones, are significantly reduced in some of the branching mutants. Furthermore, application of strigolactones inhibits shoot branching in these mutants. Strigolactones were previously found in root exudates acting as communication chemicals with parasitic weeds and symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Thus, we propose that strigolactones act as a new hormone class-or their biosynthetic precursors-in regulating above-ground plant architecture, and also have a function in underground communication with other neighbouring organisms.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Models of plant growth and development propose that changes in cell polarity are mediated by gradients of the plant hormone auxin. With use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we measured the redistribution of endogenous auxin in stems of quaking aspen trees (Populus tremuloides) after wounding. Persistent (lasting at least 24 hours) auxin gradients were observed in the region of the cambium where cell polarity was changing. A computer model of the auxin redistribution shows agreement with measured concentrations.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plant stem-cell pools, the source for all organs, are first established during embryogenesis. It has been known for decades that cytokinin and auxin interact to control organ regeneration in cultured tissue. Auxin has a critical role in root stem-cell specification in zygotic embryogenesis, but the early embryonic function of cytokinin is obscure. Here, we introduce a synthetic reporter to visualize universally cytokinin output in vivo. Notably, the first embryonic signal is detected in the hypophysis, the founder cell of the root stem-cell system. Its apical daughter cell, the precursor of the quiescent centre, maintains phosphorelay activity, whereas the basal daughter cell represses signalling output. Auxin activity levels, however, exhibit the inverse profile. Furthermore, we show that auxin antagonizes cytokinin output in the basal cell lineage by direct transcriptional activation of ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR genes, ARR7 and ARR15, feedback repressors of cytokinin signalling. Loss of ARR7 and ARR15 function or ectopic cytokinin signalling in the basal cell during early embryogenesis results in a defective root stem-cell system. These results provide a molecular model of transient and antagonistic interaction between auxin and cytokinin critical for specifying the first root stem-cell niche.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plants have evolved a tremendous ability to respond to environmental changes by adapting their growth and development. The interaction between hormonal and developmental signals is a critical mechanism in the generation of this enormous plasticity. A good example is the response to the hormone ethylene that depends on tissue type, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. By characterizing the Arabidopsis wei8 mutant, we have found that a small family of genes mediates tissue-specific responses to ethylene. Biochemical studies revealed that WEI8 encodes a long-anticipated tryptophan aminotransferase, TAA1, in the essential, yet genetically uncharacterized, indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) branch of the auxin biosynthetic pathway. Analysis of TAA1 and its paralogues revealed a link between local auxin production, tissue-specific ethylene effects, and organ development. Thus, the IPA route of auxin production is key to generating robust auxin gradients in response to environmental and developmental cues.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plants grown at high densities perceive a decrease in the red to far-red (R:FR) ratio of incoming light, resulting from absorption of red light by canopy leaves and reflection of far-red light from neighboring plants. These changes in light quality trigger a series of responses known collectively as the shade avoidance syndrome. During shade avoidance, stems elongate at the expense of leaf and storage organ expansion, branching is inhibited, and flowering is accelerated. We identified several loci in Arabidopsis, mutations in which lead to plants defective in multiple shade avoidance responses. Here we describe TAA1, an aminotransferase, and show that TAA1 catalyzes the formation of indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) from L-tryptophan (L-Trp), the first step in a previously proposed, but uncharacterized, auxin biosynthetic pathway. This pathway is rapidly deployed to synthesize auxin at the high levels required to initiate the multiple changes in body plan associated with shade avoidance.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The transcriptional response to auxin is critical for root and vascular development during Arabidopsis embryogenesis. Auxin induces the degradation of AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (AUX/IAA) transcriptional repressors, freeing their binding partners, the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) proteins, which can activate transcription of auxin response genes. We show that TOPLESS (TPL) can physically interact with IAA12/BODENLOS (IAA12/BDL) through an ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF)-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif. TPL can repress transcription in vivo and is required for IAA12/BDL repressive activity. In addition, tpl-1 can suppress the patterning defects of the bdl-1 mutant. Direct interaction between TPL and ARF5/MONOPTEROS, which is regulated by IAA12/BDL, results in a loss-of-function arf5/mp phenotype. These observations show that TPL is a transcriptional co-repressor and further our understanding of how auxin regulates transcription during plant development.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We report the draft genome sequence of the model moss Physcomitrella patens and compare its features with those of flowering plants, from which it is separated by more than 400 million years, and unicellular aquatic algae. This comparison reveals genomic changes concomitant with the evolutionary movement to land, including a general increase in gene family complexity; loss of genes associated with aquatic environments (e.g., flagellar arms); acquisition of genes for tolerating terrestrial stresses (e.g., variation in temperature and water availability); and the development of the auxin and abscisic acid signaling pathways for coordinating multicellular growth and dehydration response. The Physcomitrella genome provides a resource for phylogenetic inferences about gene function and for experimental analysis of plant processes through this plant's unique facility for reverse genetics.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant growth regulator auxin controls cell identity, cell division and cell expansion. Auxin efflux facilitators (PINs) are associated with auxin maxima in distal regions of both shoots and roots. Here we model diffusion and PIN-facilitated auxin transport in and across cells within a structured root layout. In our model, the stable accumulation of auxin in a distal maximum emerges from the auxin flux pattern. We have experimentally tested model predictions of robustness and self-organization. Our model explains pattern formation and morphogenesis at timescales from seconds to weeks, and can be understood by conceptualizing the root as an 'auxin capacitor'. A robust auxin gradient associated with the maximum, in combination with separable roles of auxin in cell division and cell expansion, is able to explain the formation, maintenance and growth of sharply bounded meristematic and elongation zones. Directional permeability and diffusion can fully account for stable auxin maxima and gradients that can instruct morphogenesis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A key feature of plants (as opposed to animals) is their ability to establish new organs not only during embryogenesis, but also throughout their development. A master regulator of organ initiation in plants is the phytohormone auxin. Auxin acts locally as a morphogen and is directionally transported from cell to cell by polarized auxin efflux carriers, termed PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins. Here we report that the Arabidopsis ortholog of the yeast and mammalian vacuolar protein sorting 29 (VPS29), a member of the retromer complex, mediates the formation of new axes of development. Furthermore, we show that VPS29 is required for endosome homeostasis, PIN protein cycling, and dynamic PIN1 repolarization during development. We propose a model that links VPS29 function, PIN1 polarity, and organ initiation in plants.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In plants, cell polarity and tissue patterning are connected by intercellular flow of the phytohormone auxin, whose directional signaling depends on polar subcellular localization of PIN auxin transport proteins. The mechanism of polar targeting of PINs or other cargos in plants is largely unidentified, with the PINOID kinase being the only known molecular component. Here, we identify PP2A phosphatase as an important regulator of PIN apical-basal targeting and auxin distribution. Genetic analysis, localization, and phosphorylation studies demonstrate that PP2A and PINOID both partially colocalize with PINs and act antagonistically on the phosphorylation state of their central hydrophilic loop, hence mediating PIN apical-basal polar targeting. Thus, in plants, polar sorting by the reversible phosphorylation of cargos allows for their conditional delivery to specific intracellular destinations. In the case of PIN proteins, this mechanism enables switches in the direction of intercellular auxin fluxes, which mediate differential growth, tissue patterning, and organogenesis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Polar transport of the signaling molecule auxin is critical for plant development and depends on both the polar distribution of auxin efflux carriers, which pump auxin out of the cell and the alignment of these polarized cells. Two papers in this issue of Cell (Michniewicz et al., 2007; Jaillais et al., 2007) address how polar transport of these carriers occurs and describe the endosomal pathways involved.</p>

In addition to halting leaf yellowing and shedding, this treatment prevents the loss of starch and nitrogen that occurs during senescence of these leaves. Although nitrogen and starch are normally redistributed to support pod growth, pod development is not impaired by this treatment, apparently because photosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation continue.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The effects of auxin on the inhibition of lateral buds in decapitated bean plants are enhanced if kinetin is applied together with auxin. The uptake of (14)C-indoleacetic acid by the stumps of decapitated plants is increased in the presence of kinetin and leads to extensive transport of (14)C-indoleacetic acid in the stems. The increased bud inhibition resulting when auxin and kinetin are applied together may be due to greater amounts of auxin reaching the buds, but an alternative explanation is that metabolites are directed from the buds to the point of hormone application.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Pectin decreases the heat coagulation of many proteins, including the soluble proteins of pea stems, ovalbumin, and bovine serum albumin. This observation probably explains the decrease in heat coagulation of proteins from pea stems following in vivo auxin administration, since auxin causes a great increase in the soluble pectin content of treated cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although amino acid auxotrophs are among the most frequently isolated mutations in microorganisms, no mutants that require amino acids have been isolated at the whole plant level. Tryptophan-requiring mutants of the cruciferous plant Arabidopsis thaliana have now been isolated by selecting for resistance to 5-methylanthranilic acid. The tryptophan requirement of one mutant, trpl-1, results from a defect in the second step of the tryptophan pathway catalyzed by anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase. Mutant trpl-1 plants are highly fluorescent and aromatic because they accumulate anthranilic acid and anthranilate beta-glucoside. Plants homozygous for the trpl-1 mutation exhibit a syndrome of morphological defects suggestive of a defect in the biosynthesis, metabolism, or localization of a tryptophan derivative such as auxin. All of these morphological phenotypes cosegregate with the tryptophan requirement as a simple Mendelian recessive trait.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>fat Nodulation (Nod) factors are lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) secreted by rhizobia to trigger the early steps of nodule organogenesis in leguminous plants. A method to synthesize LCOs in vitro was developed. Synthetic LCOs alleviated the requirement for auxin and cytokinin to sustain growth of cultured tobacco protoplasts. LCOs containing C(18:1) trans-fatty acyl substituents were more effective than those containing cis-fatty acids in promoting cell division as well as in activating an auxin-responsive promoter and the expression of a gene implicated in auxin action. These data indicate that LCOs redirect plant growth also in nonlegumes by activating developmental pathways also targeted by phytohormones.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Douglas fir plantlets were produced in tissue culture under defined conditions from cotyledon explants obtained from 2- to 4-week-old seedlings. Tissue pieces were cultured on the surface of a fabric tissue support (100 percent polyester) saturated with liquid nutrient medium; this facilitated periodic changes of the medium to meet the requirements at successive developmental stages without transfer of cultured tissues. Plant growth regulators were needed to stimulate adventitious bud formation. Plantlets were regenerated by rooting excised shoots at 19 degrees C on agarsolidified medium containing sucrose and the auxin naphthalene-2-acetic acid. After root initiation, plant growth regulators were removed; this resulted in stimulation of root elongation and the subsequent development of plantlets, which were then established in soil.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>High concentrations of indole-3-butyric acid, when applied at a concentration of 100 to 200 parts per million (ppm) to presoaked seeds, cause a marked inhibition of hypocotyl length in the seedling growth of Phaseolus mungo var. T-2. Gibberellic acid, when applied at a concentration of 5 ppm, quantitatively reversed this inhibition. It is suggested that the interaction between these two growth substances controls the morphogenetic differentiation in regard to hypocotyl formation in seedling growth.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Ani enzyme activity similar to that of dextranase is associated with coleoptiles of Avena sativa. When subjected to purified dextranase, both the pure natural dextran and the cell walls of the Avena coleoptiles yield isomaltose and isomaltotriose. Thus, the cell walls contain dextrans or dextran-like compounds. Coleoptiles with low auxin content have a lower dextranase activity than coleoptiles with high auxin content. The enzyme activity is therefore in some way sensitive to thle hormone.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The process of polar auxin transport, central to a plant's auxin relations, can be inhibited by a group of synthetic compounds that apparently act by binding to a plasma membrane protein known as the naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) receptor. No endogenous ligand to the NPA receptor, capable of affecting polar auxin transport in plants, has yet been found. It is now shown that a group of flavonoids-including quercetin, apigenin, and kaempferol-can specifically compete with [(3)H]NPA for binding to its receptor and can perturb auxin transport in a variety of plant tissues and transport systems in a manner closely paralleling the action of synthetic transport inhibitors. Because the active flavonoids are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and exert their effects at micromolar concentrations approximating likely endogenous levels, they may act as natural auxin transport regulators in plants.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Circumstantial evidence suggests that intracellular membrane trafficking pathways diversified independently in the plant kingdom, but documented examples are rare. ARF-GEFs (guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for ADP-ribosylation factor GTPases) are essential for vesicular trafficking in all eukaryotic kingdoms, but of the eight ARF-GEF families, only the ancestral BIG and GBF types are found in plants. Whereas fungal and animal GBF proteins perform conserved functions at the Golgi, the Arabidopsis thaliana GBF protein GNOM is thought to act in only the process of recycling from endosomes. We now show that the related Arabidopsis GBF protein GNOM-LIKE1 (GNL1) has an ancestral function at the Golgi but is also required for selective internalization from the plasma membrane in the presence of brefeldin A (BFA). We identified gnl1 mutants that accumulated biosynthetic and recycling endoplasmic reticulum markers in enlarged internal compartments. Notably, in the absence of functional GNL1, Golgi stacks were rendered sensitive to the selective ARF-GEF inhibitor BFA, which caused them to fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, in BFA-treated gnl1 roots, the internalization of a polar plasma-membrane marker, the auxin efflux carrier PIN2, was selectively inhibited. Thus, GNL1 is a BFA-resistant GBF protein that functions with a BFA-sensitive ARF-GEF both at the Golgi and in selective endocytosis, but not in recycling from endosomes. We propose that the evolution of endocytic trafficking in plants was accompanied by neofunctionalization within the GBF family, whereas in other kingdoms it occurred independently by elaboration of additional ARF-GEF families.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Auxin is a pivotal plant hormone that controls many aspects of plant growth and development. Perceived by a small family of F-box proteins including transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1), auxin regulates gene expression by promoting SCF ubiquitin-ligase-catalysed degradation of the Aux/IAA transcription repressors, but how the TIR1 F-box protein senses and becomes activated by auxin remains unclear. Here we present the crystal structures of the Arabidopsis TIR1-ASK1 complex, free and in complexes with three different auxin compounds and an Aux/IAA substrate peptide. These structures show that the leucine-rich repeat domain of TIR1 contains an unexpected inositol hexakisphosphate co-factor and recognizes auxin and the Aux/IAA polypeptide substrate through a single surface pocket. Anchored to the base of the TIR1 pocket, auxin binds to a partially promiscuous site, which can also accommodate various auxin analogues. Docked on top of auxin, the Aux/IAA substrate peptide occupies the rest of the TIR1 pocket and completely encloses the hormone-binding site. By filling in a hydrophobic cavity at the protein interface, auxin enhances the TIR1-substrate interactions by acting as a 'molecular glue'. Our results establish the first structural model of a plant hormone receptor.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Brassinosteroid and auxin decisively influence plant development, and overlapping transcriptional responses to these phytohormones suggest an interaction between the two pathways. However, whether this reflects direct feedback or merely parallel inputs on common targets is unclear. Here we show that in Arabidopsis roots, this interaction is mediated by BREVIS RADIX (BRX), which is required for optimal root growth. We demonstrate that the brx phenotype results from a root-specific deficiency of brassinosteroid and is due to reduced, BRX-dependent expression of a rate-limiting enzyme in brassinosteroid biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, this deficiency affects the root expression level of approximately 15% of all Arabidopsis genes, but the transcriptome profile can be restored to wild type by brassinosteroid treatment. Thus, proper brassinosteroid levels are required for the correct expression of many more genes than previously suspected. Moreover, embryonic or post-embryonic brassinosteroid application fully or partially, respectively, rescues the brx phenotype. Further, auxin-responsive gene expression is globally impaired in brx, demonstrating that brassinosteroid levels are rate-limiting for auxin-responsive transcription. BRX expression is strongly induced by auxin and mildly repressed by brassinolide, which means that BRX acts at the nexus of a feedback loop that maintains threshold brassinosteroid levels to permit optimal auxin action.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Polarized cellular distribution of the phytohormone auxin and its carriers is essential for normal plant growth and development. Polar auxin transport is maintained by a network of auxin influx (AUX) and efflux (PIN) carriers. Both auxin transport and PIN protein cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomes require the activity of the endosomal GNOM; however, intracellular routes taken by these carriers remain largely unknown. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana SORTING NEXIN 1 (AtSNX1) is involved in the auxin pathway and that PIN2, but not PIN1 or AUX1, is transported through AtSNX1-containing endosomes. We demonstrate that the snx1-null mutant exhibits multiple auxin-related defects and that loss of function of AtSNX1 severely enhances the phenotype of a weak gnom mutant. In root cells, we further show that AtSNX1 localizes to an endosomal compartment distinct from GNOM-containing endosomes, and that PIN2 accumulates in this compartment after treatment with the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase inhibitor wortmannin or after a gravity stimulus. Our data reveal the existence of a novel endosomal compartment involved in PIN2 endocytic sorting and plant development.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Small-molecule hormones govern every aspect of the biology of plants. Many processes, such as growth, are regulated in similar ways by multiple hormones, and recent studies have revealed extensive crosstalk among different hormonal signaling pathways. These results have led to the proposal that a common set of signaling components may integrate inputs from multiple hormones to regulate growth. In this study, we tested this proposal by asking whether different hormones converge on a common set of transcriptional targets in Arabidopsis seedlings. Using publicly available microarray data, we analyzed the transcriptional effects of seven hormones, including abscisic acid, gibberellin, auxin, ethylene, cytokinin, brassinosteroid, and jasmonate. A high-sensitivity analysis revealed a surprisingly low number of common target genes. Instead, different hormones appear to regulate distinct members of protein families. We conclude that there is not a core transcriptional growth-regulatory module in young Arabidopsis seedlings.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The AUX1 and PIN auxin influx and efflux facilitators are key regulators of root growth and development. For root gravitropism to occur, AUX1 and PIN2 must transport auxin via the lateral root cap to elongating epidermal cells. Genetic studies suggest that AXR4 functions in the same pathway as AUX1. Here we show that AXR4 is a previously unidentified accessory protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that regulates localization of AUX1 but not of PIN proteins. Loss of AXR4 resulted in abnormal accumulation of AUX1 in the ER of epidermal cells, indicating that the axr4 agravitropic phenotype is caused by defective AUX1 trafficking in the root epidermis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plants and animals activate defenses after perceiving pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as bacterial flagellin. In Arabidopsis, perception of flagellin increases resistance to the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, although the molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we show that a flagellin-derived peptide induces a plant microRNA (miRNA) that negatively regulates messenger RNAs for the F-box auxin receptors TIR1, AFB2, and AFB3. Repression of auxin signaling restricts P. syringae growth, implicating auxin in disease susceptibility and miRNA-mediated suppression of auxin signaling in resistance.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Polar flow of the phytohormone auxin requires plasma membrane-associated PIN proteins and underlies multiple developmental processes in plants. Here we address the importance of the polarity of subcellular PIN localization for the directionality of auxin transport in Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of different PINs in the root epidermis revealed the importance of PIN polar positions for directional auxin flow and root gravitropic growth. Interfering with sequence-embedded polarity signals directly demonstrates that PIN polarity is a primary factor in determining the direction of auxin flow in meristematic tissues. This finding provides a crucial piece in the puzzle of how auxin flow can be redirected via rapid changes in PIN polarity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Intercellular flow of the phytohormone auxin underpins multiple developmental processes in plants. Plant-specific pin-formed (PIN) proteins and several phosphoglycoprotein (PGP) transporters are crucial factors in auxin transport-related development, yet the molecular function of PINs remains unknown. Here, we show that PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. Conditional gain-of-function alleles and quantitative measurements of auxin accumulation in Arabidopsis and tobacco cultured cells revealed that the action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGP, rate-limiting, specific to auxins, and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. This suggests a direct involvement of PINs in catalyzing cellular auxin efflux.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plants and some animals have a profound capacity to regenerate organs from adult tissues. Molecular mechanisms for regeneration have, however, been largely unexplored. Here we investigate a local regeneration response in Arabidopsis roots. Laser-induced wounding disrupts the flow of auxin-a cell-fate-instructive plant hormone-in root tips, and we demonstrate that resulting cell-fate changes require the PLETHORA, SHORTROOT, and SCARECROW transcription factors. These transcription factors regulate the expression and polar position of PIN auxin efflux-facilitating membrane proteins to reconstitute auxin transport in renewed root tips. Thus, a regeneration mechanism using embryonic root stem-cell patterning factors first responds to and subsequently stabilizes a new hormone distribution.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plants continuously maintain pools of totipotent stem cells in their apical meristems from which elaborate root and shoot systems are produced. In Arabidopsis thaliana, stem cell fate in the shoot apical meristem is controlled by a regulatory network that includes the CLAVATA (CLV) ligand-receptor system and the homeodomain protein WUSCHEL (WUS). Phytohormones such as auxin and cytokinin are also important for meristem regulation. Here we show a mechanistic link between the CLV/WUS network and hormonal control. WUS, a positive regulator of stem cells, directly represses the transcription of several two-component ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR genes (ARR5, ARR6, ARR7 and ARR15), which act in the negative-feedback loop of cytokinin signalling. These data indicate that ARR genes might negatively influence meristem size and that their repression by WUS might be necessary for proper meristem function. Consistent with this hypothesis is our observation that a mutant ARR7 allele, which mimics the active, phosphorylated form, causes the formation of aberrant shoot apical meristems. Conversely, a loss-of-function mutation in a maize ARR homologue was recently shown to cause enlarged meristems.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The transport of auxin controls developmental events in plants. Here, we report that in addition to maintaining vacuolar pH, the H+-pyrophosphatase, AVP1, controls auxin transport and consequently auxin-dependent development. AVP1 overexpression results in increased cell division at the onset of organ formation, hyperplasia, and increased auxin transport. In contrast, avp1-1 null mutants have severely disrupted root and shoot development and reduced auxin transport. Changes in the expression of AVP1 affect the distribution and abundance of the P-adenosine triphosphatase and Pinformed 1 auxin efflux facilitator, two proteins implicated in auxin distribution. Thus, AVP1 facilitates the auxin fluxes that regulate organogenesis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>One of the mechanisms by which signalling molecules regulate cellular behaviour is modulating subcellular protein translocation. This mode of regulation is often based on specialized vesicle trafficking, termed constitutive cycling, which consists of repeated internalization and recycling of proteins to and from the plasma membrane. No such mechanism of hormone action has been shown in plants although several proteins, including the PIN auxin efflux facilitators, exhibit constitutive cycling. Here we show that a major regulator of plant development, auxin, inhibits endocytosis. This effect is specific to biologically active auxins and requires activity of the Calossin-like protein BIG. By inhibiting the internalization step of PIN constitutive cycling, auxin increases levels of PINs at the plasma membrane. Concomitantly, auxin promotes its own efflux from cells by a vesicle-trafficking-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, asymmetric auxin translocation during gravitropism is correlated with decreased PIN internalization. Our data imply a previously undescribed mode of plant hormone action: by modulating PIN protein trafficking, auxin regulates PIN abundance and activity at the cell surface, providing a mechanism for the feedback regulation of auxin transport.</p>

The direction of auxin flow and the distribution of auxin within tissues are regulated by auxin efflux transporters that are polarly localized in cells.

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Despite 100 years of evidence showing a pivotal role for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) in plant development, the mechanism of auxin perception has remained elusive. Central to auxin response are changes in gene expression, brought about by auxin-induced interaction between the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor proteins and the ubiquitin-ligase complex SCF(TIR1), thus targeting for them proteolysis. Regulated SCF-mediated protein degradation is a widely occurring signal transduction mechanism. Target specificity is conferred by the F-box protein subunit of the SCF (TIR1 in the case of Aux/IAAs) and there are multiple F-box protein genes in all eukaryotic genomes examined so far. Although SCF-target interaction is usually regulated by signal-induced modification of the target, we have previously shown that auxin signalling involves the modification of SCF(TIR1). Here we show that this modification involves the direct binding of auxin to TIR1 and thus that TIR1 is an auxin receptor mediating transcriptional responses to auxin.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant hormone auxin regulates diverse aspects of plant growth and development. Recent studies indicate that auxin acts by promoting the degradation of the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors through the action of the ubiquitin protein ligase SCF(TIR1). The nature of the signalling cascade that leads to this effect is not known. However, recent studies indicate that the auxin receptor and other signalling components involved in this response are soluble factors. Using an in vitro pull-down assay, we demonstrate that the interaction between transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) and Aux/IAA proteins does not require stable modification of either protein. Instead auxin promotes the Aux/IAA-SCF(TIR1) interaction by binding directly to SCF(TIR1). We further show that the loss of TIR1 and three related F-box proteins eliminates saturable auxin binding in plant extracts. Finally, TIR1 synthesized in insect cells binds Aux/IAA proteins in an auxin-dependent manner. Together, these results indicate that TIR1 is an auxin receptor that mediates Aux/IAA degradation and auxin-regulated transcription.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Local accumulation of the plant growth regulator auxin mediates pattern formation in Arabidopsis roots and influences outgrowth and development of lateral root- and shoot-derived primordia. However, it has remained unclear how auxin can simultaneously regulate patterning and organ outgrowth and how its distribution is stabilized in a primordium-specific manner. Here we show that five PIN genes collectively control auxin distribution to regulate cell division and cell expansion in the primary root. Furthermore, the joint action of these genes has an important role in pattern formation by focusing the auxin maximum and restricting the expression domain of PLETHORA (PLT) genes, major determinants for root stem cell specification. In turn, PLT genes are required for PIN gene transcription to stabilize the auxin maximum at the distal root tip. Our data reveal an interaction network of auxin transport facilitators and root fate determinants that control patterning and growth of the root primordium.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Polar transport-dependent local accumulation of auxin provides positional cues for multiple plant patterning processes. This directional auxin flow depends on the polar subcellular localization of the PIN auxin efflux regulators. Overexpression of the PINOID protein kinase induces a basal-to-apical shift in PIN localization, resulting in the loss of auxin gradients and strong defects in embryo and seedling roots. Conversely, pid loss of function induces an apical-to-basal shift in PIN1 polar targeting at the inflorescence apex, accompanied by defective organogenesis. Our results show that a PINOID-dependent binary switch controls PIN polarity and mediates changes in auxin flow to create local gradients for patterning processes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A small organizing center, the quiescent center (QC), maintains stem cells in the Arabidopsis root and defines the stem cell niche. The phytohormone auxin influences the position of this niche by an unknown mechanism. Here, we identify the PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2 genes encoding AP2 class putative transcription factors, which are essential for QC specification and stem cell activity. The PLT genes are transcribed in response to auxin accumulation and are dependent on auxin response transcription factors. Distal PLT transcript accumulation creates an overlap with the radial expression domains of SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW, providing positional information for the stem cell niche. Furthermore, the PLT genes are activated in the basal embryo region that gives rise to hypocotyl, root, and root stem cells and, when ectopically expressed, transform apical regions to these identities. Thus, the PLT genes are key effectors for establishment of the stem cell niche during embryonic pattern formation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Phyllotaxy describes the geometric pattern of leaves and flowers, and has intrigued botanists and mathematicians for centuries. How these patterns are initiated is poorly understood, and this is partly due to the paucity of mutants. Signalling by the plant hormone auxin appears to determine the site of leaf initiation; however, this observation does not explain how distinct patterns of phyllotaxy are initiated. abphyl1 (abph1) mutants of maize initiate leaves in a decussate pattern (that is, paired at 180 degrees), in contrast to the alternating or distichous phyllotaxy observed in wild-type maize and other grasses. Here we show that ABPH1 is homologous to two-component response regulators and is induced by the plant hormone cytokinin. ABPH1 is expressed in the embryonic shoot apical meristem, and its spatial expression pattern changes rapidly with cytokinin treatment. We propose that ABPH1 controls phyllotactic patterning by negatively regulating the cytokinin-induced expansion of the shoot meristem, thereby limiting the space available for primordium initiation at the apex.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plants, compared to animals, exhibit an amazing adaptability and plasticity in their development. This is largely dependent on the ability of plants to form new organs, such as lateral roots, leaves, and flowers during postembryonic development. Organ primordia develop from founder cell populations into organs by coordinated cell division and differentiation. Here, we show that organ formation in Arabidopsis involves dynamic gradients of the signaling molecule auxin with maxima at the primordia tips. These gradients are mediated by cellular efflux requiring asymmetrically localized PIN proteins, which represent a functionally redundant network for auxin distribution in both aerial and underground organs. PIN1 polar localization undergoes a dynamic rearrangement, which correlates with establishment of auxin gradients and primordium development. Our results suggest that PIN-dependent, local auxin gradients represent a common module for formation of all plant organs, regardless of their mature morphology or developmental origin.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The regular arrangement of leaves around a plant's stem, called phyllotaxis, has for centuries attracted the attention of philosophers, mathematicians and natural scientists; however, to date, studies of phyllotaxis have been largely theoretical. Leaves and flowers are formed from the shoot apical meristem, triggered by the plant hormone auxin. Auxin is transported through plant tissues by specific cellular influx and efflux carrier proteins. Here we show that proteins involved in auxin transport regulate phyllotaxis. Our data indicate that auxin is transported upwards into the meristem through the epidermis and the outermost meristem cell layer. Existing leaf primordia act as sinks, redistributing auxin and creating its heterogeneous distribution in the meristem. Auxin accumulation occurs only at certain minimal distances from existing primordia, defining the position of future primordia. This model for phyllotaxis accounts for its reiterative nature, as well as its regularity and stability.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Axis formation occurs in plants, as in animals, during early embryogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism is not known. Here we show that the first manifestation of the apical-basal axis in plants, the asymmetric division of the zygote, produces a basal cell that transports and an apical cell that responds to the signalling molecule auxin. This apical-basal auxin activity gradient triggers the specification of apical embryo structures and is actively maintained by a novel component of auxin efflux, PIN7, which is located apically in the basal cell. Later, the developmentally regulated reversal of PIN7 and onset of PIN1 polar localization reorganize the auxin gradient for specification of the basal root pole. An analysis of pin quadruple mutants identifies PIN-dependent transport as an essential part of the mechanism for embryo axis formation. Our results indicate how the establishment of cell polarity, polar auxin efflux and local auxin response result in apical-basal axis formation of the embryo, and thus determine the axiality of the adult plant.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A transferred DNA (T-DNA) tagging vector with the potential to produce dominant mutations was used with cocultured Agrobacterium tumefaciens and protoplasts to tag genes involved in the action of the plant growth substance auxin. Transgenic calli were selected for their ability to grow in the absence of auxin in the culture media. From one experiment, 12 calli that displayed this phenotype were recovered, of which 11 were able to regenerate into plants. In one plant studied in detail, protoplast division in the absence of auxin genetically cosegregated with a single T-DNA insert. A messenger RNA encoded by a 6.4-kilobase sequence of plant genomic DNA rescued from the mutant is overexpressed relative to untransformed plants. The genomic DNA, as well as a cognate complementary DNA, once transfected into protoplasts promote growth and cell division in vitro in the absence of exogenously added auxin.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Agriculturally advantageous reduction in plant height is usually achieved by blocking the action or production of gibberellins. Here, we describe a different dwarfing mechanism found in maize brachytic2 (br2) mutants characterized by compact lower stalk internodes. The height reduction in these plants results from the loss of a P-glycoprotein that modulates polar auxin transport in the maize stalk. The sorghum ortholog of br2 is dwarf3 (dw3), an unstable mutant of long-standing commercial interest and concern. A direct duplication within the dw3 gene is responsible for its mutant nature and also for its instability, because it facilitates unequal crossing-over at the locus.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The success of the green revolution largely resulted from the creation of dwarf cultivars of wheat and rice, which had much higher yields than conventional crops. Characterization of these dwarf cultivars showed that the mutant genes were involved in either the synthesis or signaling of gibberellin, a plant growth hormone. In his Perspective, Salamini highlights new work (Multani et al.) that identifies the cause of dwarfism in agronomically important varieties of maize and sorghum. In these cases, dwarfism is caused by defective transport of another growth hormone called auxin.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>beta-Hydroxyethylhydrazine forces flowering of pineapple plants, possibly by reducing auxin concentration. A specific and sensitive assay showed that beta-hydroxyethylhydrazine (3.3 x 10(-7)M) inhibits noncompetitively and almost completely the oxidation of tryptamine to indoleacetaldehyde by extracts of pea-seedling (Pisum sativum L. var. Alaska). The relative rate of oxidation of putrescine to Delta(1)-pyrroline compared to that of tryptamine by these extracts and the inhibition of both reactions by beta-hydroxyethylhydrazine suggest that diamine oxidase is inhibited. beta-Hydroxyethylhydrazine is a potent inhibitor in vivo of animal diamine oxidase.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Coumarin, usually regarded as an inhibitor of growth processes in plants, markedly stimulated the elongation of excised segments of Helianthus hypocotyls. Substitution in the molecule of hydroxy-, methyl-, or chloro-groups, in the neighborhood of the unsaturated bond in the lactone ring, markedly altered the growth-promoting activity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Gibberellic acid promotes doubling, early flowering, and fruiting directly in Impatiens. It also lengthens the stem, probably through a neutralization of auxin inhibitors. Such a mechanism would leave the growth-promoting auxins unchecked to produce the increased elongation characteristic of gibberellin application. It seems that application of additional auxin produces a rapid build-up of the auxin inhibitor(s) in the plant.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Auxin is a plant hormone that regulates many aspects of plant growth and development. We used a chemical genetics approach to identify SIR1, a regulator of many auxin-inducible genes. The sir1 mutant was resistant to sirtinol, a small molecule that activates many auxin-inducible genes and promotes auxin-related developmental phenotypes. SIR1 is predicted to encode a protein composed of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like domain and a Rhodanese-like domain homologous to that of prolyl isomerase. We suggest a molecular context for how the auxin signal is propagated to exert its biological effects.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Many aspects of plant growth and development are dependent on the flow of the hormone auxin down the plant from the growing shoot tip where it is synthesized. The direction of auxin transport in stems is believed to result from the basal localization within cells of the PIN1 membrane protein, which controls the efflux of the auxin anion. Mutations in two genes homologous to those encoding the P-glycoprotein ABC transporters that are especially abundant in multidrug-resistant tumour cells in animals were recently shown to block polar auxin transport in the hypocotyls of Arabidopsis seedlings. Here we show that the mdr mutants display faster and greater gravitropism and enhanced phototropism instead of the impaired curvature development expected in mutants lacking polar auxin transport. We find that these phenotypes result from a disruption of the normal accumulation of PIN1 protein along the basal end of hypocotyl cells associated with basipetal auxin flow. Lateral auxin conductance becomes relatively larger as a result, enhancing the growth differentials responsible for tropic responses.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Glucose modulates many vital processes in photosynthetic plants. Analyses of Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2 (gin2) mutants define the physiological functions of a specific hexokinase (HXK1) in the plant glucose-signaling network. HXK1 coordinates intrinsic signals with extrinsic light intensity. HXK1 mutants lacking catalytic activity still support various signaling functions in gene expression, cell proliferation, root and inflorescence growth, and leaf expansion and senescence, thus demonstrating the uncoupling of glucose signaling from glucose metabolism. The gin2 mutants are also insensitive to auxin and hypersensitive to cytokinin. Plants use HXK as a glucose sensor to interrelate nutrient, light, and hormone signaling networks for controlling growth and development in response to the changing environment.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The growth of plant organs is influenced by a stream of the phytohormone auxin that flows from the shoot apex to the tip of the root. However, until now it has not been known how auxin regulates the cell proliferation and enlargement that characterizes organ growth. Here we show that auxin controls the growth of roots by modulating cellular responses to the phytohormone gibberellin (GA). GA promotes the growth of plants by opposing the effects of nuclear DELLA protein growth repressors, one of which is Arabidopsis RGA (for repressor of gal-3). GA opposes the action of several DELLA proteins by destabilizing them, reducing both the concentration of detectable DELLA proteins and their growth-restraining effects. We also show that auxin is necessary for GA-mediated control of root growth, and that attenuation of auxin transport or signalling delays the GA-induced disappearance of RGA from root cell nuclei. Our observations indicate that the shoot apex exerts long-distance control on the growth of plant organs through the effect of auxin on GA-mediated DELLA protein destabilization.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Exchange factors for ARF GTPases (ARF-GEFs) regulate vesicle trafficking in a variety of organisms. The Arabidopsis protein GNOM is a brefeldin A (BFA) sensitive ARF-GEF that is required for the proper polar localization of PIN1, a candidate transporter of the plant hormone auxin. Mutations in GNOM lead to developmental defects that resemble those caused by interfering with auxin transport. Both PIN1 localization and auxin transport are also sensitive to BFA. In this paper, we show that GNOM localizes to endosomes and is required for their structural integrity. We engineered a BFA-resistant version of GNOM. In plants harboring this fully functional GNOM variant, PIN1 localization and auxin transport are no longer sensitive to BFA, while trafficking of other proteins is still affected by the drug. Our results demonstrate that GNOM is required for the recycling of auxin transport components and suggest that ARF-GEFs regulate specific endosomal trafficking pathways.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant hormone indole-3 acetic acid (IAA or auxin) controls many aspects of plant development, including the production of lateral roots. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis has a central role in this process. The genes AXR1 and TIR1 aid the assembly of an active SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box) complex that probably promotes degradation of the AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors in response to auxin. The transcription activator NAC1, a member of the NAM/CUC family of transcription factors, functions downstream of TIR1 to transduce the auxin signal for lateral root development. Here we show that SINAT5, an Arabidopsis homologue of the RING-finger Drosophila protein SINA, has ubiquitin protein ligase activity and can ubiquitinate NAC1. This activity is abolished by mutations in the RING motif of SINAT5. Overexpressing SINAT5 produces fewer lateral roots, whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative Cys49 --&gt; Ser mutant of SINAT5 develops more lateral roots. These lateral root phenotypes correlate with the expression of NAC1 observed in vivo. Low expression of NAC1 in roots can be increased by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, which indicates that SINAT5 targets NAC1 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis to downregulate auxin signals in plant cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In contrast to animals, little is known about pattern formation in plants. Physiological and genetic data suggest the involvement of the phytohormone auxin in this process. Here, we characterize a novel member of the PIN family of putative auxin efflux carriers, Arabidopsis PIN4, that is localized in developing and mature root meristems. Atpin4 mutants are defective in establishment and maintenance of endogenous auxin gradients, fail to canalize externally applied auxin, and display various patterning defects in both embryonic and seedling roots. We propose a role for AtPIN4 in generating a sink for auxin below the quiescent center of the root meristem that is essential for auxin distribution and patterning.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Long-standing models propose that plant growth responses to light or gravity are mediated by asymmetric distribution of the phytohormone auxin. Physiological studies implicated a specific transport system that relocates auxin laterally, thereby effecting differential growth; however, neither the molecular components of this system nor the cellular mechanism of auxin redistribution on light or gravity perception have been identified. Here, we show that auxin accumulates asymmetrically during differential growth in an efflux-dependent manner. Mutations in the Arabidopsis gene PIN3, a regulator of auxin efflux, alter differential growth. PIN3 is expressed in gravity-sensing tissues, with PIN3 protein accumulating predominantly at the lateral cell surface. PIN3 localizes to the plasma membrane and to vesicles that cycle in an actin-dependent manner. In the root columella, PIN3 is positioned symmetrically at the plasma membrane but rapidly relocalizes laterally on gravity stimulation. Our data indicate that PIN3 is a component of the lateral auxin transport system regulating tropic growth. In addition, actin-dependent relocalization of PIN3 in response to gravity provides a mechanism for redirecting auxin flux to trigger asymmetric growth.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant hormone auxin is central in many aspects of plant development. Previous studies have implicated the ubiquitin-ligase SCF(TIR1) and the AUX/IAA proteins in auxin response. Dominant mutations in several AUX/IAA genes confer pleiotropic auxin-related phenotypes, whereas recessive mutations affecting the function of SCF(TIR1) decrease auxin response. Here we show that SCF(TIR1) is required for AUX/IAA degradation. We demonstrate that SCF(TIR1) interacts with AXR2/IAA7 and AXR3/IAA17, and that domain II of these proteins is necessary and sufficient for this interaction. Further, auxin stimulates binding of SCF(TIR1) to the AUX/IAA proteins, and their degradation. Because domain II is conserved in nearly all AUX/IAA proteins in Arabidopsis, we propose that auxin promotes the degradation of this large family of transcriptional regulators, leading to diverse downstream effects.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Polar transport of the phytohormone auxin mediates various processes in plant growth and development, such as apical dominance, tropisms, vascular patterning and axis formation. This view is based largely on the effects of polar auxin transport inhibitors. These compounds disrupt auxin efflux from the cell but their mode of action is unknown. It is thought that polar auxin flux is caused by the asymmetric distribution of efflux carriers acting at the plasma membrane. The polar localization of efflux carrier candidate PIN1 supports this model. Here we show that the seemingly static localization of PIN1 results from rapid actin-dependent cycling between the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments. Auxin transport inhibitors block PIN1 cycling and inhibit trafficking of membrane proteins that are unrelated to auxin transport. Our data suggest that PIN1 cycling is of central importance for auxin transport and that auxin transport inhibitors affect efflux by generally interfering with membrane-trafficking processes. In support of our conclusion, the vesicle-trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A mimics physiological effects of auxin transport inhibitors.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Gravitropism, the bending of plants in response to gravity, is caused by differential growth rates on two sides of a responding organ. The general belief, although somewhat controversial, is that auxins play a major role in gravitropism by controlling the rate of cell extension. The tissue print technique was used to ascertain the distribution of auxin-regulated RNAs during the gravitropic response of soybean hypocotyls. In vertically oriented seedlings, auxin-regulated RNAs are symmetrically distributed in the elongating region of the hypocotyl. In horizontally orientated seedlings the distribution becomes asymmetrical within 20 minutes and the greatest asymmetry coincides with the onset of rapid bending. The results provide a clear correlation between the dynamic expression of genes under auxin control and a morphogenetic phenomenon traditionally known as an auxin response.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Phototropism and gravitropism in the shoots and roots of higher plants are the result of asymmetric growth. This is explained by the redistribution of growth regulators following exposure to gravity or unilateral light (the Cholodny-Went hypothesis). The positive phototropism and the negative geotropism of grass seedling coleoptiles are believed to result from lateral movement of auxin from the irradiated to the shaded side and from the upper to the lower side, respectively. Many physiological processes in plants, including auxin-induced cell elongation, are reported to be under the control of calcium. Added auxin triggers oscillations in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) and cytosolic pH (pHcyt) in epidermal cells of maize coleoptiles. Until recently, it has not been possible to visualize these changes spatially with the commonly used fluorescent cation indicators. Using a scanning laser confocal microscope, a new visible wavelength Ca2+ probe fluo-3 and the fluorescent pH indicator BCECF, we have recorded rapid light-induced increases in [Ca2+]cyt and a lowering of pHcyt of cells on the shaded side of maize coleoptiles. In horizontally orientated coleoptiles, [Ca2+]cyt increases and pHcyt decreases in the more rapidly elongating cells on the lower side. For the first time, rapid changes in [Ca2+]cyt and pHcyt are correlated directly with increases in cell elongation stimulated by light and gravity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Tomato plants homozygous for the diageotropica (dgt) mutation exhibit morphological and physiological abnormalities which suggest that they are unable to respond to the plant growth hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid). The photoaffinity auxin analog [3H]5N3-IAA specifically labels a polypeptide doublet of 40 and 42 kilodaltons in membrane preparations from stems of the parental variety, VFN8, but not from stems of plants containing the dgt mutation. In roots of the mutant plants, however, labeling is indistinguishable from that in VFN8. These data suggest that the two polypeptides are part of a physiologically important auxin receptor system, which is altered in a tissue-specific manner in the mutant.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The COP9 signalosome is an evolutionary conserved multiprotein complex of unknown function that acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenic seedling development in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that plants with reduced COP9 signalosome levels had decreased auxin response similar to loss-of-function mutants of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFTIR1. Furthermore, we found that the COP9 signalosome and SCFTIR1 interacted in vivo and that the COP9 signalosome was required for efficient degradation of PSIAA6, a candidate substrate of SCFTIR1. Thus, the COP9 signalosome may play an important role in mediating E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated responses.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although auxin is known to regulate many processes in plant development and has been studied for over a century, the mechanisms whereby plants produce it have remained elusive. Here we report the characterization of a dominant Arabidopsis mutant, yucca, which contains elevated levels of free auxin. YUCCA encodes a flavin monooxygenase-like enzyme and belongs to a family that includes at least nine other homologous Arabidopsis genes, a subset of which appears to have redundant functions. Results from tryptophan analog feeding experiments and biochemical assays indicate that YUCCA catalyzes hydroxylation of the amino group of tryptamine, a rate-limiting step in tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Arabidopsis plants carrying mutations in the PINOID (PID) gene have a pleiotropic shoot phenotype that mimics that of plants grown on auxin transport inhibitors or of plants mutant for the auxin efflux carrier PINFORMED (PIN), with defects in the formation of cotyledons, flowers, and floral organs. We have cloned PID and find that it is transiently expressed in the embryo and in initiating floral anlagen, demonstrating a specific role for PID in promoting primordium development. Constitutive expression of PID causes a phenotype in both shoots and roots that is similar to that of auxin-insensitive plants, implying that PID, which encodes a serine-threonine protein kinase, negatively regulates auxin signaling.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Root formation in plants involves the continuous interpretation of positional cues. Physiological studies have linked root formation to auxins. An auxin response element displays a maximum in the Arabidopsis root and we investigate its developmental significance. Auxin response mutants reduce the maximum or its perception, and interfere with distal root patterning. Polar auxin transport mutants affect its localization and distal pattern. Polar auxin transport inhibitors cause dramatic relocalization of the maximum, and associated changes in pattern and polarity. Auxin application and laser ablations correlate root pattern with a maximum adjacent to the vascular bundle. Our data indicate that an auxin maximum at a vascular boundary establishes a distal organizer in the root.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The plant hormone auxin is transported in a polar manner along the shoot-root axis, which requires efflux carriers such as PIN1. Asymmetric localization of PIN1 develops from a random distribution in Arabidopsis early embryogenesis. Coordinated polar localization of PIN1 is defective in gnom embryos. GNOM is a membrane-associated guanine-nucleotide exchange factor on ADP-ribosylation factor G protein (ARF GEF). Thus, GNOM-dependent vesicle trafficking may establish cell polarity, resulting in polar auxin transport.</p>
