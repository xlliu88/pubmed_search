    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In the quest for plant regulatory sequences capable of driving nematode-triggered effector gene expression in feeding structures, we show that promoter tagging is a valuable tool. A large collection of transgenic Arabidopsis plants was generated. They were transformed with a beta-glucuronidase gene functioning as a promoter tag. Three T-DNA constructs, pGV1047, p delta gusBin19, and pMOG553, were used. Early responses to nematode invasion were of primary interest. Six lines exhibiting beta-glucuronidase activity in syncytia induced by the beet cyst nematode were studied. Reporter gene activation was also identified in galls induced by root knot and ectoparasitic nematodes. Time-course studies revealed that all six tags were differentially activated during the development of the feeding structure. T-DNA-flanking regions responsible for the observed responses after nematode infection were isolated and characterized for promoter activity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plant-parasitic cyst nematodes synthesize and secrete effector proteins that are essential for parasitism. One such protein is the 10A07 effector from the sugar beet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii, which is exclusively expressed in the nematode dorsal gland cell during all nematode parasitic stages. Overexpression of H. schachtii 10A07 in Arabidopsis thaliana produced a hypersusceptible phenotype in response to H. schachtii infection along with developmental changes reminiscent of auxin effects. The 10A07 protein physically associates with a plant kinase and the IAA16 transcription factor in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. The interacting plant kinase (IPK) phosphorylates 10A07 at Ser-144 and Ser-231 and mediates its trafficking from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Translocation to the nucleus is phosphorylation dependent since substitution of Ser-144 and Ser-231 by alanine resulted in exclusive cytoplasmic accumulation of 10A07. IPK and IAA16 are highly upregulated in the nematode-induced syncytium (feeding cells), and deliberate manipulations of their expression significantly alter plant susceptibility to H. schachtii in an additive fashion. An inactive variant of IPK functioned antagonistically to the wild-type IPK and caused a dominant-negative phenotype of reduced plant susceptibility. Thus, exploitation of host processes to the advantage of the parasites is one mechanism by which cyst nematodes promote parasitism of host plants.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Plant-parasitic cyst nematodes secrete a complex of cell wall-digesting enzymes, which aid in root penetration and migration. The soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines also produces a cellulose binding protein (Hg CBP) secretory protein. To determine the function of CBP, an orthologous cDNA clone (Hs CBP) was isolated from the sugar beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii, which is able to infect Arabidopsis thaliana. CBP is expressed only in the early phases of feeding cell formation and not during the migratory phase. Transgenic Arabidopsis expressing Hs CBP developed longer roots and exhibited enhanced susceptibility to H. schachtii. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified Arabidopsis pectin methylesterase protein 3 (PME3) as strongly and specifically interacting with Hs CBP. Transgenic plants overexpressing PME3 also produced longer roots and exhibited increased susceptibility to H. schachtii, while a pme3 knockout mutant showed opposite phenotypes. Moreover, CBP overexpression increases PME3 activity in planta. Localization studies support the mode of action of PME3 as a cell wall-modifying enzyme. Expression of CBP in the pme3 knockout mutant revealed that PME3 is required but not the sole mechanism for CBP overexpression phenotype. These data indicate that CBP directly interacts with PME3 thereby activating and potentially targeting this enzyme to aid cyst nematode parasitism.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>When sedentary endoparasitic nematodes infect plants, they induce complex feeding sites within the root tissues of their host. To characterize cell wall changes induced within these structures at a molecular level, we studied the expression of an extensin gene (coding for a major structural cell wall protein) in nematode-infected tobacco roots. Extensin gene expression was observed to be induced very early upon infection. This induction was weak, transient, and probably due to wounding during penetration and migration of the tobacco cyst nematode Globodera tabacum ssp solanacea-rum. In contrast, high extensin gene expression was observed during the whole second larval stage (an ~2-week-long phase of establishment of the feeding site) of the root knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica. During later stages of this interaction, expression gradually decreased. Extensin gene expression was found in at least three different tissues of the gall. We propose that distinct mechanisms lead to induced expression in these different cell types. The significance of these results for the understanding of plant-nematode interactions as well as the function of structural cell wall proteins, such as extensin, is discussed.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Cyst nematodes and root-knot nematodes elaborately transform cells within the vascular cylinders of plant roots into enlarged, multinucleate, and metabolically active feeding cells. The giant cells of root-knot nematodes are formed by repeated karyokinesis uncoupled from cytokinesis, whereas the syncytia formed by cyst nematodes arise from coordinated cell wall dissolution and the coalescing of cell cytoplasm of adjacent cells. Both giant cells and syncytia undergo extensive cell wall architectural modifications, including thickening and the formation of numerous ingrowths that increase the plasmalemma surface area for solute uptake. The origin of enzymes involved in these cell wall modifications has been the subject of debate for several decades. Immunolocalization of endo-beta-1,4-glucanases (EGases) secreted from cyst nematodes was observed in root cortical tissue during the intracellular migration of the nematodes, but secretion of cyst nematode EGases into developing syncytia was not detected. We have identified five EGase genes from tobacco that are upregulated within plant roots upon infection by both root-knot and cyst nematodes. In situ localization of tobacco EGase transcripts demonstrated that their expression was specifically and developmentally upregulated within giant cells, syncytia, root tips, and lateral root primordia. These data confirm that cell wall modifications within plant-parasitic-nematode feeding cells arise from cell wall-modifying enzymes of plant, rather than nematode, origin.</p>
