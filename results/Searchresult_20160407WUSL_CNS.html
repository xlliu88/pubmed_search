    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) mediates rapid excitatory responses through ligand-gated channels (5-HT3 receptors). Recombinant expression of the only identified receptor subunit (5-HT3A) yields functional 5-HT3 receptors. However, the conductance of these homomeric receptors (sub-picosiemens) is too small to be resolved directly, and contrasts with a robust channel conductance displayed by neuronal 5-HT3 receptors (9-17 pS). Neuronal 5-HT3 receptors also display a permeability to calcium ions and a current-voltage relationship that differ from those of homomeric receptors. Here we describe a new class of 5-HT3-receptor subunit (5-HT3B). Transcripts of this subunit are co-expressed with the 5-HT3A subunit in the amygdala, caudate and hippocampus. Heteromeric assemblies of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits display a large single-channel conductance (16 pS), low permeability to calcium ions, and a current-voltage relationship which resembles that of characterized neuronal 5-HT3 channels. The heteromeric receptors also display distinctive pharmacological properties. Surprisingly, the M2 region of the 5-HT3B subunit lacks any of the structural features that are known to promote the conductance of related receptors. In addition to providing a new target for therapeutic agents, the 5-HT3B subunit will be a valuable resource for defining the molecular mechanisms of ion-channel function.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, activates three different receptors that directly gate ion channels, namely receptors for AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl isoxozole propionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), and kainate, a structural analogue of glutamate. The contribution of AMPA and NMDA receptors to synaptic transmission and plasticity is well established. Recent work on the physiological function of kainate receptors has focused on the hippocampus, where repetitive activation of the mossy-fibre pathway generates a slow, kainate-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). Here we show that high-intensity single-shock stimulation (of duration 200 microseconds) of primary afferent sensory fibres produces a fast, kainate-receptor-mediated EPSC in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Activation of low-threshold afferent fibres generates typical AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs only, indicating that kainate receptors may be restricted to synapses formed by high-threshold nociceptive (pain-sensing) and thermoreceptive primary afferent fibres. Consistent with this possibility, kainate-receptor-mediated EPSCs are blocked by the analgesic mu-opiate-receptor agonist Damgo and spinal blockade of both kainate and AMPA receptors produces antinociception. Thus, spinal kainate receptors contribute to transmission of somatosensory inputs from the periphery to the brain.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Throughout the developing nervous system, competition between axons causes the permanent removal of some synaptic connections. In mouse neuromuscular junctions at birth, terminal branches of different axons are intermingled. However, during the several weeks after birth, these branches progressively segregated into nonoverlapping compartments before the complete withdrawal of all but one axon. Segregation was caused by selective branch atrophy, detachment, and withdrawal; the axon branches that were nearest to the competitor's branches were removed before the more distant branches were removed. This progression suggests that the signals that mediate the competitive removal of synapses must decrease in potency over short distances.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Virtually all uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli encode filamentous surface adhesive organelles called type 1 pili. High-resolution electron microscopy of infected mouse bladders revealed that type 1 pilus tips interacted directly with the lumenal surface of the bladder, which is embedded with hexagonal arrays of integral membrane glycoproteins known as uroplakins. Attached pili were shortened and facilitated intimate contact of the bacteria with the uroplakin-coated host cells. Bacterial attachment resulted in exfoliation of host bladder epithelial cells as part of an innate host defense system. Exfoliation occurred through a rapid apoptosis-like mechanism involving caspase activation and host DNA fragmentation. Bacteria resisted clearance in the face of host defenses within the bladder by invading into the epithelium.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Glycine receptors are anchored at inhibitory chemical synapses by a cytoplasmic protein, gephyrin. Molecular cloning revealed the similarity of gephyrin to prokaryotic and invertebrate proteins essential for synthesizing a cofactor required for activity of molybdoenzymes. Gene targeting in mice showed that gephyrin is required both for synaptic clustering of glycine receptors in spinal cord and for molybdoenzyme activity in nonneural tissues. The mutant phenotype resembled that of humans with hereditary molybdenum cofactor deficiency and hyperekplexia (a failure of inhibitory neurotransmission), suggesting that gephyrin function may be impaired in both diseases.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple cell metabolism to electrical activity. Phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) profoundly antagonized ATP inhibition of KATP channels when applied to inside-out membrane patches. It is proposed that membrane-incorporated PIPs can bind to positive charges in the cytoplasmic region of the channel's Kir6.2 subunit, stabilizing the open state of the channel and antagonizing the inhibitory effect of ATP. The tremendous effect of PIPs on ATP sensitivity suggests that in vivo alterations of membrane PIP levels will have substantial effects on KATP channel activity and hence on the gain of metabolism-excitation coupling.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Checkpoints maintain the order and fidelity of events of the cell cycle by blocking mitosis in response to unreplicated or damaged DNA. In most species this is accomplished by preventing activation of the cell-division kinase Cdc2, which regulates entry into mitosis. The Chk1 kinase, an effector of the DNA-damage checkpoint, phosphorylates Cdc25, an activator of Cdc2. Phosphorylation of Cdc25 promotes its binding to 14-3-3 proteins, preventing it from activating Cdc2. Here we propose that a similar pathway is required for mitotic arrest in the presence of unreplicated DNA (that is, in the replication checkpoint) in fission yeast. We show by mutagenesis that Chk1 functions redundantly with the kinase Cds1 at the replication checkpoint and that both kinases phosphorylate Cdc25 on the same sites, which include serine residues at positions 99, 192 and 359. Mutation of these residues reduces binding of 14-3-3 proteins to Cdc25 in vitro and disrupts the replication checkpoint in vivo. We conclude that both Cds1 and Chk1 regulate the binding of Cdc25 to 14-3-3 proteins as part of the checkpoint response to unreplicated DNA.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Recognition of antigen by T cells requires the formation of a specialized junction between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell. This junction is generated by the recruitment and the exclusion of specific proteins from the contact area. The mechanisms that regulate these events are unknown. Here we demonstrate that ligand engagement of the adhesion molecule, CD2, initiates a process of protein segregation, CD2 clustering, and cytoskeletal polarization. Although protein segregation was not dependent on the cytoplasmic domain of CD2, CD2 clustering and cytoskeletal polarization required an interaction of the CD2 cytoplasmic domain with a novel SH3-containing protein. This novel protein, called CD2AP, is likely to facilitate receptor patterning in the contact area by linking specific adhesion receptors to the cytoskeleton.</p>

The net synthesis reactions of 11 amino acids were exergonic in the hydrothermal solution, but all were endergonic in surface seawater. The synthesis of the requisite amino acids of nine thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins in a 100 degreesC hydrothermal solution yielded between 600 and 8000 kilojoules per mole of protein, which is energy that is available to drive the intracellular synthesis of enzymes and other biopolymers in hyperthermophiles thriving in these ecosystems.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The T cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta heterodimer interacts with its ligands with high specificity, but surprisingly low affinity. The role of the zeta component of the murine TCR in contributing to the fidelity of antigen recognition was examined. With sequence-specific phosphotyrosine antibodies, it was found that zeta undergoes a series of ordered phosphorylation events upon TCR engagement. Completion of phosphorylation steps is dependent on the nature of the TCR ligand. Thus, the phosphorylation steps establish thresholds for T cell activation. This study documents the sophisticated molecular events that follow the engagement of a low-affinity receptor.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes directly oppose each other at chemical synapses, minimizing the delay in transmitting information across the synaptic cleft. Extrasynaptic neuronal surfaces, in contrast, are almost entirely covered by processes from glial cells. The exclusion of glial cells from the synaptic cleft, and the long-term stability of synapses, presumably result in large part from the tight adhesion between presynaptic and postsynaptic elements. Here we show that there is another requirement for synaptic maintenance: glial cells of the skeletal neuromuscular synapse, Schwann cells, are actively inhibited from entering the synaptic cleft between the motor nerve terminal and the muscle fibre. One inhibitory component is laminin 11, a heterotrimeric glycoprotein that is concentrated in the synaptic cleft. Regulation of an inhibitory interaction between glial cells and synaptic cleft components may contribute to synaptic rearrangements, and loss of this inhibition may underlie the loss of synapses that results from injury to the postsynaptic cell.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Neurons in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord are important for conveying sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Some synapses between primary afferent fibres and spinal dorsal horn neurons may be inefficient or silent. Ineffective sensory transmission could result from a small postsynaptic current that fails to depolarize the cell to threshold for an action potential or from a cell with a normal postsynaptic current but an increased threshold for action potentials. Here we show that some cells in the superficial dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord have silent synapses: they do not respond unless the holding potential is moved from -70 mV to +40 mV. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), an important neurotransmitter of the raphe-spinal projecting pathway, transforms silent glutamatergic synapses into functional ones. Therefore, transformation of silent glutamatergic synapses may serve as a cellular mechanism for central plasticity in the spinal cord.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Two- and three-dimensional computer imaging shows that endocranial capacity in an approximately 2.8- to 2.6-million-year-old early hominid cranium (Stw 505) from Sterkfontein, South Africa, tentatively assigned to Australopithecus africanus, is approximately 515 cubic centimeters. Although this is the largest endocranial capacity recorded for this species, it is still markedly less than anecdotal reports of endocranial capacity exceeding 600 cubic centimeters. No australopithecine has an endocranial capacity approaching, let alone exceeding, 600 cubic centimeters. Some currently accepted estimates of early hominid endocranial capacity may be inflated, suggesting that the tempo and mode of early hominid brain evolution may need reevaluation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Checkpoint controls ensure that events of the cell-division cycle are completed with fidelity and in the correct order. In budding yeast with a mutation in the motor protein dynein, the mitotic spindle is often misaligned and therefore slow to enter the neck between mother cell and budding daughter cell. When this occurs, cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm into two) is delayed until the spindle is properly positioned. Here we describe mutations that abolish this delay, indicating the existence of a new checkpoint mechanism. One mutation lies in the gene encoding the yeast homologue of EB1, a human protein that binds the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, a tumour suppressor. EB1 is located on microtubules of the mitotic spindle and is important in spindle assembly. EB1 may therefore, by associating with microtubules, contribute to the sensor mechanism that activates the checkpoint. Another mutation affects Stt4, a phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase. Cold temperature is an environmental stimulus that causes misalignment of the mitotic spindle in yeast and appears to activate this checkpoint mechanism.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Notch proteins are ligand-activated transmembrane receptors involved in cell-fate selection throughout development. No known enzymatic activity is contained within Notch and the molecular mechanism by which it transduces signals across the cell membrane is poorly understood. In many instances, Notch activation results in transcriptional changes in the nucleus through an association with members of the CSL family of DNA-binding proteins (where CSL stands for CBF1, Su(H), Lag-1). As Notch is located in the plasma membrane and CSL is a nuclear protein, two models have been proposed to explain how they interact. The first suggests that the two interact transiently at the membrane. The second postulates that Notch is cleaved by a protease, enabling the cleaved fragment to enter the nucleus. Here we show that signalling by a constitutively active membrane-bound Notch-1 protein requires the proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which interacts preferentially with CSL. Very small amounts of NICD are active, explaining why it is hard to detect in the nucleus in vivo. We also show that it is ligand binding that induces release of NICD.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Herein we report the generation of mice lacking the ubiquitously expressed Janus kinase, Jak1. Jak1-/- mice are runted at birth, fail to nurse, and die perinatally. Although Jak1-/- cells are responsive to many cytokines, they fail to manifest biologic responses to cytokines that bind to three distinct families of cytokine receptors. These include all class II cytokine receptors, cytokine receptors that utilize the gamma(c) subunit for signaling, and the family of cytokine receptors that depend on the gp130 subunit for signaling. Our results thus demonstrate that Jak1 plays an essential and nonredundant role in promoting biologic responses induced by a select subset of cytokine receptors, including those in which Jak utilization was thought to be nonspecific.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Overexpression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) by muscle greatly increased the number of motor axons innervating neuromuscular junctions in neonatal mice. The extent of hyperinnervation correlated with the amount of GDNF expressed in four transgenic lines. Overexpression of GDNF by glia and overexpression of neurotrophin-3 and neurotrophin-4 in muscle did not cause hyperinnervation. Thus, increased amounts of GDNF in postsynaptic target cells can regulate the number of innervating axons.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Previously, we found that Rb can actively repress transcription of cell cycle genes by binding and inactivating transcription factors at the promoter. Here, we demonstrate that Rb can also repress transcription of endogenous cell cycle genes containing E2F sites through recruitment of histone deacetylase, which deacetylates histones on the promoter, thereby promoting formation of nucleosomes that inhibit transcription. These two mechanisms of repression by Rb are selective-some promoters and transcription factors are blocked by this recruitment of histone deacetylase, whereas others are resistant to histone deacetylase activity and are repressed directly by inhibition of transcription factors.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Strains of Escherichia coli persist within the human gut as normal commensals, but are frequent pathogens and can cause recurrent infection. Here we show that, in contrast to E. coli subjected to opsonic interactions stimulated by the host's immune response, E. coli that bind to the macrophage surface exclusively through the bacterial lectin FimH can survive inside the cell following phagocytosis. This viability is largely due to the attenuation of intracellular free-radical release and of phagosome acidification during FimH-mediated internalization, both of which are triggered by antibody-mediated internalization. This different processing of non-opsonized bacteria is supported by morphological evidence of tight-fitting phagosomes compared with looser, antibody-mediated phagosomes. We propose that non-opsonized FimH-expressing E. coli co-opt internalization of lipid-rich microdomains following binding to the FimH receptor, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein CD48, because (1) the sterol-binding agents filipin, nystatin and methyl beta-cyclodextrin specifically block FimH-mediated internalization; (2) CD48 and the protein caveolin both accumulate on macrophage membranes surrounding bacteria; and (3) antibodies against CD48 inhibit FimH-mediated internalization. Our findings bring the traditionally extracellular E. coli into the realm of opportunistic intracellular parasitism and suggest how opportunistic infections with FimH-expressing enterobacteria could occur in a setting deprived of opsonizing antibodies.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Apoptosis of mouse neocortical neurons induced by serum deprivation or by staurosporine was associated with an early enhancement of delayed rectifier (IK) current and loss of total intracellular K+. This IK augmentation was not seen in neurons undergoing excitotoxic necrosis or in older neurons resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Attenuating outward K+ current with tetraethylammonium or elevated extracellular K+, but not blockers of Ca2+, Cl-, or other K+ channels, reduced apoptosis, even if associated increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration were prevented. Furthermore, exposure to the K+ ionophore valinomycin or the K+-channel opener cromakalim induced apoptosis. Enhanced K+ efflux may mediate certain forms of neuronal apoptosis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>To determine which proteinases are responsible for the lung destruction characteristic of pulmonary emphysema, macrophage elastase-deficient (MME-/-) mice were subjected to cigarette smoke. In contrast to wild-type mice, MME-/- mice did not have increased numbers of macrophages in their lungs and did not develop emphysema in response to long-term exposure to cigarette smoke. Smoke-exposed MME-/- mice that received monthly intratracheal instillations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 showed accumulation of alveolar macrophages but did not develop air space enlargement. Thus, macrophage elastase is probably sufficient for the development of emphysema that results from chronic inhalation of cigarette smoke.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Dystrophin is a cytoskeletal protein of muscle fibers; its loss in humans leads to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an inevitably fatal wasting of skeletal and cardiac muscle. mdx mice also lack dystrophin, but are only mildly dystrophic. Utrophin, a homolog of dystrophin, is confined to the postsynaptic membrane at skeletal neuromuscular junctions and has been implicated in synaptic development. However, mice lacking utrophin show only subtle neuromuscular defects. Here, we asked whether the mild phenotypes of the two single mutants reflect compensation between the two proteins. Synaptic development was qualitatively normal in double mutants, but dystrophy was severe and closely resembled that seen in Duchenne. Thus, utrophin attenuates the effects of dystrophin deficiency, and the double mutant may provide a useful model for studies of pathogenesis and therapy.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Crystal structures of binary and ternary complexes of the E. coli Rep helicase bound to single-stranded (ss) DNA or ssDNA and ADP were determined to a resolution of 3.0 A and 3.2 A, respectively. The asymmetric unit in the crystals contains two Rep monomers differing from each other by a large reorientation of one of the domains, corresponding to a swiveling of 130 degrees about a hinge region. Such domain movements are sufficiently large to suggest that these may be coupled to translocation of the Rep dimer along DNA. The ssDNA binding site involves the helicase motifs Ia, III, and V, whereas the ADP binding site involves helicase motifs I and IV. Residues in motifs II and VI may function to transduce the allosteric effects of nucleotides on DNA binding. These structures represent the first view of a DNA helicase bound to DNA.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Human Cdc25C is a dual-specificity protein phosphatase that controls entry into mitosis by dephosphorylating the protein kinase Cdc2. Throughout interphase, but not in mitosis, Cdc25C was phosphorylated on serine-216 and bound to members of the highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed family of 14-3-3 proteins. A mutation preventing phosphorylation of serine-216 abrogated 14-3-3 binding. Conditional overexpression of this mutant perturbed mitotic timing and allowed cells to escape the G2 checkpoint arrest induced by either unreplicated DNA or radiation-induced damage. Chk1, a fission yeast kinase involved in the DNA damage checkpoint response, phosphorylated Cdc25C in vitro on serine-216. These results indicate that serine-216 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding negatively regulate Cdc25C and identify Cdc25C as a potential target of checkpoint control in human cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death due to an infectious organism, killing an estimated 3 million people annually. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, and other pathogenic mycobacteria require entry into host macrophages to initiate infection. An invasion mechanism was defined that was shared among pathogenic mycobacteria including M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, and M. avium but not by nonpathogenic mycobacteria or nonmycobacterial intramacrophage pathogens. This pathway required the association of the complement cleavage product C2a with mycobacteria resulting in the formation of a C3 convertase. The mycobacteria-associated C2a cleaved C3, resulting in C3b opsonization of the mycobacteria and recognition by macrophages.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The discovery of homologues from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae of the human Ku DNA-end-binding proteins (HDF1 and KU80) has established that this organism is capable of non-homologous double-strand end joining (NHEJ), a form of DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) active in mammalian V(D)J recombination. Identification of the DNA ligase that mediates NHEJ in yeast will help elucidate the function of the four mammalian DNA ligases in DSBR, V(D)J recombination and other reactions. Here we show that S. cerevisiae has two typical DNA ligases, the known DNA ligase I homologue CDC9 and the previously unknown DNA ligase IV homologue DNL4. dnl4 mutants are deficient in precise and end-processed NHEJ. DNL4 and HDF1 are epistatic in this regard, with the mutation of each having equivalent effects. dnl4 mutants are complemented by overexpression of Dnl4 but not of Cdc9, and deficiency of Dnl4 alone does not impair either cell growth or the Cdc9-mediated responses to ionizing and ultraviolet radiation. Thus, S. cerevisiae has two distinct and separate ligation pathways.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Mutation of the XRCC4 gene in mammalian cells prevents the formation of the signal and coding joints in the V(D)J recombination reaction, which is necessary for production of a functional immunoglobulin gene, and renders the cells highly sensitive to ionizing radiation. However, XRCC4 shares no sequence homology with other proteins, nor does it have a biochemical activity to indicate what its function might be. Here we show that DNA ligase IV co-immunoprecipitates with XRCC4 and that these two proteins specifically interact with one another in a yeast two-hybrid system. Ligation of DNA double-strand breaks in a cell-free system by DNA ligase IV is increased fivefold by purified XRCC4 and seven- to eightfold when XRCC4 is co-expressed with DNA ligase IV. We conclude that the biological consequences of mutating XRCC4 are primarily due to the loss of its stimulatory effect on DNA ligase IV: the function of the XRCC4-DNA ligase IV complex may be to carry out the final steps of V(D)J recombination and joining of DNA ends.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>More than 1% of the world's population is chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection can result in acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis, which is strongly associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Genetic studies of HCV replication have been hampered by lack of a bona fide infectious molecular clone. Full-length functional clones of HCV complementary DNA were constructed. RNA transcripts from the clones were found to be infectious and to cause disease in chimpanzees after direct intrahepatic inoculation. This work defines the structure of a functional HCV genome RNA and proves that HCV alone is sufficient to cause disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>C-peptide, a cleavage product from the processing of proinsulin to insulin, has been considered to possess little if any biological activity other than its participation in insulin synthesis. Injection of human C-peptide prevented or attenuated vascular and neural (electrophysiological) dysfunction and impaired Na+- and K+-dependent adenosine triphosphate activity in tissues of diabetic rats. Nonpolar amino acids in the midportion of the peptide were required for these biological effects. Synthetic reverse sequence (retro) and all-D-amino acid (enantio) C-peptides were equipotent to native C-peptide, which indicates that the effects of C-peptide on diabetic vascular and neural dysfunction were mediated by nonchiral interactions instead of stereospecific receptors or binding sites.</p>

The composition of the remnant metal was unchanged. These results are contrary to theoretical predictions that sulfide formation in the solar nebula produced troilite (FeS) and enriched the remaining metal in nickel. The experimental sulfides are chemically and morphologically similar to sulfide grains in the matrix of the Alais (class CI) carbonaceous chondrite, suggesting that these meteoritic sulfides may be condensates from the solar nebula.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Auditory signals are transmitted from the inner ear through the brainstem to the higher auditory regions of the brain. Neurons throughout the auditory system are tuned to stimulus frequency, and in many auditory regions are arranged in topographical maps with respect to their preferred frequency. These properties are assumed to arise from the interactions of convergent and divergent projections ascending from lower to higher auditory areas; such a view, however, ignores the possible role of descending projections from cortical to subcortical regions. In the bat auditory system, such corticofugal connections modulate neuronal activity to improve the processing of echo-delay information, a specialized feature. Here we show that corticofugal projections are also involved in the most common type of auditory processing, frequency tuning. When cortical neurons tuned to a specific frequency are inactivated, the auditory responses of subcortical neurons tuned to the same frequency are reduced. Moreover, the responses of other subcortical neurons tuned to different frequencies are increased, and their preferred frequencies are shifted towards that of the inactivated cortical neurons. Thus the corticofugal system mediates a positive feedback which, in combination with widespread lateral inhibition, sharpens and adjusts the tuning of neurons at earlier stages in the auditory processing pathway.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The source of increasing viremia that characterizes the latter stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease has remained a paradox because it occurs at a time when lymphoid tissue is quantitatively and qualitatively impaired, and the patients' CD4 T lymphocytes are steadily declining. Here, macrophages, both infected and uninfected with common opportunistic pathogens of HIV disease such as Mycobacterium avium complex and Pneumocystis carinii, were identified as highly productive sources of HIV in coinfected lymph nodes. These observations indicate that tissue macrophages are not only infected with HIV, but that common pathogens of HIV disease can dramatically increase their production of virus. Thus, prevention or successful treatment of opportunistic coinfections, or both, potentially benefits the patient twofold by limiting the pathology caused by opportunistic infection and by controlling induction of HIV replication.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In the vertebrate brain, neurons grouped in parallel laminae receive distinct sets of synaptic inputs. In the avian optic tectum, arbors and synapses of most retinal axons are confined to 3 of 15 laminae. The adhesion molecule N-cadherin and cell surface glycoconjugates recognized by a plant lectin are selectively associated with these "retinorecipient" laminae. The lectin and a monoclonal antibody to N-cadherin perturbed laminar selectivity in distinct fashions. In contrast, neurotrophins increased the complexity of retinal arbors without affecting their laminar distribution. Thus, cell surface molecules and soluble trophic factors may collaborate to shape lamina-specific arbors in the brain, with the former predominantly affecting their position and the latter their size.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Pathological disturbances of mood may follow a 'bipolar' course, in which normal moods alternate with both depression and mania, or a 'unipolar' course, in which only depression occurs. Both bipolar and unipolar disorders can be heritable illnesses associated with neurochemical, neuroendocrine and autonomic abnormalities. The neurobiological basis for these abnormalities has not been established. Using positron emission tomographic (PET) images of cerebral blood flow and rate of glucose metabolism to measure brain activity, we have now localized an area of abnormally decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex ventral to the genu of the corpus callosum in both familial bipolar depressives and familial unipolar depressives. This decrement in activity was at least partly explained by a corresponding reduction in cortical volume, as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated reductions in the mean grey matter volume in the same area of 39 and 48% in the bipolar and unipolar samples, respectively. This region has previously been implicated in the mediation of emotional and autonomic responses to socially significant or provocative stimuli, and in the modulation of the neurotransmitter systems targeted by antidepressant drugs.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells and the principal resorptive cells of bone. Although osteoclasts are of myeloid origin, the role of haematopoietic transcription factors in osteoclastogenesis has not been explored. Here we show that messenger RNA for the myeloid- and B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 progressively increases as marrow macrophages assume the osteoclast phenotype in vitro. The association between PU.1 and osteoclast differentiation was confirmed by demonstrating that PU.1 expression increased with the induction of osteoclastogenesis by either 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or dexamethasone. Consistent with the participation of PU.1 in osteoclastogenesis, we found that the development of both osteoclasts and macrophages is arrested in PU.1-deficient mice. Reflecting the absence of osteoclasts, PU.1-/- mice exhibit the classic hallmarks of osteopetrosis, a family of sclerotic bone diseases. These animals were rescued by marrow transplantation, with complete restoration of osteoclast and macrophage differentiation, verifying that the PU.1 lesion is intrinsic to haematopoietic cells. The absence of both osteoclasts and macrophages in PU.1-mutant animals suggests that the transcription factor regulates the initial stages of myeloid differentiation, and that its absence represents the earliest developmental osteopetrotic mutant yet described.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Hox11 is an orphan homeobox gene that controls the genesis of the spleen. HOX11 is also oncogenic, having been isolated from a chromosomal breakpoint in human T-cell leukaemia. Transgenic mice that redirected HOX11 to the thymus demonstrated cell-cycle aberration and progression to malignancy. We observed that the protein HOX11 interacted with protein serine-threonine phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC), as well as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1C) in mammalian cells. Inhibition of PP2A can regulate the cell cycle and control the activation of maturation-promoting factor in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjection of HOX11 into Xenopus oocytes arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle promoted progression to the M phase. G2 arrest can be induced by gamma-irradiation, but is eliminated by expression of HOX11 within a T-cell line. Thus HOX11 is a cellular oncogene that targets PP2A and PP1, both of which are targets for oncogenic viruses and chemical tumour promoters. This interaction suggests a mechanism by which a homeobox can alter the cell cycle.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Many structural features of the mammalian central nervous system can be explained by a morphogenetic mechanism that involves mechanical tension along axons, dendrites and glial processes. In the cerebral cortex, for example, tension along axons in the white matter can explain how and why the cortex folds in a characteristic species-specific pattern. In the cerebellum, tension along parallel fibres can explain why the cortex is highly elongated but folded like an accordion. By keeping the aggregate length of axonal and dendritic wiring low, tension should contribute to the compactness of neural circuitry throughout the adult brain.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The kinetic mechanism by which the DNA repair helicase UvrD of Escherichia coli unwinds duplex DNA was examined with the use of a series of oligodeoxynucleotides with duplex regions ranging from 10 to 40 base pairs. Single-turnover unwinding experiments showed distinct lag phases that increased with duplex length because partially unwound DNA intermediate states are highly populated during unwinding. Analysis of these kinetics indicates that UvrD unwinds duplex DNA in discrete steps, with an average "step size" of 4 to 5 base pairs (approximately one-half turn of the DNA helix). This suggests an unwinding mechanism in which alternating subunits of the dimeric helicase interact directly with duplex DNA.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Permanent removal of axonal input to postsynaptic cells helps shape the pattern of neuronal connections in response to experience, but the process is poorly understood. Intracellular recording from newborn and adult mouse muscle fibers temporarily innervated by two axons showed an increasing disparity in the synaptic strengths of the two inputs before one was eliminated. The connection that survived gained strength by increasing the amount of neurotransmitter released (quantal content), whereas the input that was subsequently removed became progressively weaker, because of a reduction in quantal content and a reduction in quantal efficacy associated with reduced postsynaptic receptor density. Once the synaptic strengths of two inputs began to diverge, complete axonal withdrawal of the weaker input occurred within 1 to 2 days. These experiments provide a link between experience-driven changes in synaptic strength and long-term changes in connectivity in the mammalian nervous system.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The normal development of the vertebrate nervous system entails the death of 30-70% of the neurons originally generated in most neuronal populations. This naturally occurring cell death is regulated by specific neurotrophic factors that promote neuronal survival and which are produced in limiting quantities by target cells, glial cells and neurons. These factors are also of potential utility as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe the purification and cloning of a new neurotrophic factor, identified on the basis of its ability to support the survival of sympathetic neurons in culture. This factor, neurturin, is structurally related to glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). These factors can each activate the MAP kinase signalling pathway in cultured sympathetic neurons and support the survival of sympathetic neurons, as well as of sensory neurons of the nodose and dorsal root ganglia. Thus, neurturin and GDNF together now define a new family of neurotrophic factors.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Extracellular survival factors alter a cell's susceptibility to apoptosis, often through posttranslational mechanisms. However, no consistent relationship has been established between such survival signals and the BCL-2 family, where the balance of death agonists versus antagonists determines susceptibility. One distant member, BAD, heterodimerizes with BCL-X(L) or BCL-2, neutralizing their protective effect and promoting cell death. In the presence of survival factor IL-3, cells phosphorylated BAD on two serine residues embedded in 14-3-3 consensus binding sites. Only the nonphosphorylated BAD heterodimerized with BCL-X(L) at membrane sites to promote cell death. Phosphorylated BAD was sequestered in the cytosol bound to 14-3-3. Substitution of serine phosphorylation sites further enhanced BAD's death-promoting activity. The rapid phosphorylation of BAD following IL-3 connects a proximal survival signal with the BCL-2 family, modulating this checkpoint for apoptosis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Granulocyte [polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN)] migration to sites of infection and subsequent activation is essential for host defense. Gene-targeted mice deficient for integrin-associated protein (IAP, also termed CD47) succumbed to Escherichia coli peritonitis at inoccula survived by heterozygous littermates. In vivo, they had an early defect in PMN accumulation at the site of infection. In vitro, IAP-/- PMNs were deficient in beta3 integrin-dependent ligand binding, activation of an oxidative burst, and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Thus, IAP plays a key role in host defense by participating both in PMN migration in response to bacterial infection and in PMN activation at extravascular sites.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mediates the translocation of viral messenger RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In yeast, Rev can mediate the nuclear export of Rev response-element-containing RNAs. The export of Rev itself proceeds through the nuclear pore complex and requires a nuclear export signal (NES) and interaction with a cellular cofactor, the protein Rip1. Endogenous RNA export mediators that interact with Rip1 and harbour NESs are thought to exist but have yet to be identified. Here we report the characterization of a new and essential yeast protein, Gle1, which contains an NES and has a relative molecular mass of 62,000. Mutation of the NES in Gle1 prevents export of polyadenylated RNA from the nucleus. Gle1 interacts with Rip1 and the nucleoporin Nup100 and is localized predominantly at nuclear pore complexes. These properties indicate that Gle1 is an RNA-export factor and that Rev may mediate viral RNA export by mimicking the function of Gle1.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Signaling pathways using heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide-binding-proteins (G proteins) trigger physiological responses elicited by hormones, neurotransmitters and sensory stimuli. GTP binding activates G proteins by dissociating G alpha from G beta gamma subunits, and GTP hydrolysis by G alpha subunits deactivates G proteins by allowing heterotrimers to reform. However, deactivation of G-protein signalling pathways in vivo can occur 10- to 100-fold faster than the rate of GTP hydrolysis of G alpha subunits in vitro, suggesting that GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) deactivate G alpha subunits. Here we report that RGS (for regulator of G-protein signalling) proteins are GAPs for G alpha subunits. RGS1, RGS4 and GAIP (for G alpha-interacting protein) bind specifically and tightly to G alphai and G alpha0 in cell membranes treated with GDP and AlF4(-), and are GAPs for G alphai, G alpha0 and transducin alpha-subunits, but not for G alphas. Thus, these RGS proteins are likely to regulate a subset of the G-protein signalling pathways in mammalian cells. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms that govern the duration and specificity of physiological responses elicited by G-protein-mediated signalling pathways.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The maintenance and significance of the complex populations of microbes present in the mammalian intestine are poorly understood. Comparison of conventionally housed and germ-free NMRI mice revealed that production of fucosylated glycoconjugates and an alpha1, 2-fucosyltransferase messenger RNA in the small-intestinal epithelium requires the normal microflora. Colonization of germ-free mice with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a component of this flora, restored the fucosylation program, whereas an isogenic strain carrying a transposon insertion that disrupts its ability to use L-fucose as a carbon source did not. Simplified models such as this should aid the study of open microbial ecosystems.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The induction of cascades of virulence factors after contact between bacteria and host cells was investigated. P-pili mediate the binding of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to its host cell receptor. After P-pili binding there was transcriptional activation of a sensor-regulator protein that is essential for the bacterial iron-starvation response. An insertion mutation of the sensor-regulator gene eliminated the ability of uropathogenic E. coli to produce siderophores and their iron-regulated membrane receptors, thereby abolishing their ability to grow in urine. These results suggest that P-pilus-mediated attachment may be an important part of the sensor-regulatory process involved in uropathogenic E. coli urinary tract infection.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The immediate-early transcription factor NGFI-A (also called Egr-1, zif/268, or Krox-24) is thought to couple extracellular signals to changes in gene expression. Although activins and inhibins regulate follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis, no factor has been identified that exclusively regulates luteinizing hormone (LH) synthesis. An analysis of NGFI-A-deficient mice derived from embryonic stem cells demonstrated female infertility that was secondary to LH-beta deficiency. Ovariectomy led to increased amounts of FSH-beta but not LH-beta messenger RNA, which suggested a pituitary defect. A conserved, canonical NGFI-A site in the LH-beta promoter was required for synergistic activation by NGFI-A and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1). NGFI-A apparently influences female reproductive capacity through its regulation of LH-beta transcription.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A complete skeleton of a large-bodied New World monkey has been found in Pleistocene cave deposits in the Brazilian state of Bahia. It demonstrates an unprecedented combination of body size, locomotor and cranial morphology. Skeletal features indicate an animal of approximately 25 kg, more than twice the mass of any living South American monkey. We refer the specimen to Protopithecus brasiliensis Lund, 1838, a large Pleistocene primate originally represented by only a proximal femur and distal humerus. The skeleton resembles species of two distinct New World monkey lineages. The cranium is modified for an enlarged vocal sac typical of living howler monkeys, and the postcranium includes suspensory and brachiating components of locomotion as seen in living spider and woolly spider monkeys. This skeleton confirms that adaptive diversity in neotropical primates was greater in the recent past, and that current interpretations of how their distinctive adaptations evolved should be revised.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The Jamaican mustached bat has delay-tuned neurons in the inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, and auditory cortex. The responses of these neurons to an echo are facilitated by a biosonar pulse emitted by the bat when the echo returns with a particular delay from a target located at a particular distance. Electrical stimulation of cortical delay-tuned neurons increases the delay-tuned responses of collicular neurons tuned to the same echo delay as the cortical neurons and decreases those of collicular neurons tuned to different echo delays. Cortical neurons improve information processing in the inferior colliculus by way of the corticocollicular projection.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Affinity maturation by somatic hypermutation is thought to occur within germinal centres. Mice deficient in lymphotoxin-alpha (LT alpha-/- mice) have no lymph nodes or Peyer's patches, and fail to form germinal centres in the spleen. We tested whether germinal centres are essential for maturation of antibody responses to T-cell-dependent antigens. LT alpha-/- mice immunized with low doses of (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl-ovalbumin (NP-OVA) showed dramatically impaired production of high-affinity anti-NP IgG1. However, LT alpha-/- mice immunized with high doses of NP-OVA, even though they failed to produce germinal centres, manifested a high-affinity anti-NP IgG1 response similar to wild-type mice. Furthermore, when LT alpha-/- mice were multiply immunized with high doses of NP-OVA, the predominantly expressed anti-NP VH gene segment VH186.2 showed somatic mutations typical of affinity maturation. Thus, B-cell memory and affinity maturation are not absolutely dependent on the presence of germinal centres.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The degenerin family of proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans is homologous to subunits of the mammalian amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels. Mutations in nematode degenerins cause cell death, probably because of defects in channel function. Genetic evidence was obtained that the unc-105 gene product represents a degenerin homolog affecting C. elegans muscles and that this putative channel interacts with type IV collagen in the extracellular matrix underlying the muscle cell. This interaction may serve as a mechanism of stretch-activated muscle contraction, and this system could provide a molecular model for the activation of mechanosensitive ion channels.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Signaling molecules are essential for vertebrate embryonic development. Here, two Xenopus homologs of the Drosophila gene fringe, lunatic Fringe (lFng) and radical Fringe (rFng), were identified and the protein product of lFng further characterized. The messenger RNA of lFng is supplied as a maternal message. Its product is a precursor protein consisting of pre-, pro-, and mature regions. The mature lunatic Fringe protein is secreted extracellularly, and it induced mesodermal tissue formation in animal cap assays. These results indicate that secreted lunatic Fringe can induce mesoderm and reveal that the Fringe proteins are a family of vertebrate signaling molecules.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>During neuromuscular synapse formation, motor axons induce clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the muscle fiber membrane. The protein agrin, originally isolated from the basal lamina of the synaptic cleft, is synthesized and secreted by motoneurons and triggers formation of AChR clusters on cultured myotubes. We show here postsynaptic AChR aggregates are markedly reduced in number, size, and density in muscles of agrin-deficient mutant mice. These results support the hypothesis that agrin is a critical organizer of postsynaptic differentiation does occur in the mutant, suggesting the existence of a second-nerve-derived synaptic organizing signal. In addition, we show that intramuscular nerve branching and presynaptic differentiation are abnormal in the mutant, phenotypes which may reflect either a distinct effect of agrin or impaired retrograde signaling from a defective postsynaptic apparatus.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple the cellular metabolic state to electrical activity and are a critical link between blood glucose concentration and pancreatic insulin secretion. A mutation in the second nucleotide-binding fold (NBF2) of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) of an individual diagnosed with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy generated KATP channels that could be opened by diazoxide but not in response to metabolic inhibition. The hamster SUR, containing the analogous mutation, had normal ATP sensitivity, but unlike wild-type channels, inhibition by ATP was not antagonized by adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Additional mutations in NBF2 resulted in the same phenotype, whereas an equivalent mutation in NBF1 showed normal sensitivity to MgADP. Thus, by binding to SUR NBF2 and antagonizing ATP inhibition of KATP++ channels, intracellular MgADP may regulate insulin secretion.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The threshold at which antigen triggers lymphocyte activation is set by the enzymes that regulate tyrosine phosphorylation. Upon T cell activation, the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was found to bind to the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. This interaction resulted in an increase in SHP-1 phosphatase activity and a decrease in ZAP-70 kinase activity. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of SHP-1 in T cells increased the sensitivity of the antigen receptor. Thus, SHP-1 functions as a negative regulator of the T cell antigen receptor and in setting the threshold of activation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Zinc is present in presynaptic nerve terminals throughout the mammalian central nervous system and likely serves as an endogenous signaling substance. However, excessive exposure to extracellular zinc can damage central neurons. After transient forebrain ischemia in rats, chelatable zinc accumulated specifically in degenerating neurons in the hippocampal hilus and CA1, as well as in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum, and amygdala. This accumulation preceded neurodegeneration, which could be prevented by the intraventricular injection of a zinc chelating agent. The toxic influx of zinc may be a key mechanism underlying selective neuronal death after transient global ischemic insults.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The JAK-STAT signaling pathway has been implicated in mediating biological responses induced by many cytokines. However, cytokines that promote distinct cellular responses often activate identical STAT proteins, thereby raising the question of how specificity is manifest within this signaling pathway. Here we report the generation and characterization of mice deficient in STAT1. STAT1-deficient mice show no overt developmental abnormalities, but display a complete lack of responsiveness to either IFN alpha or IFN gamma and are highly sensitive to infection by microbial pathogens and viruses. In contrast, these mice respond normally to several other cytokines that activate STAT1 in vitro. These observations document that STAT1 plays an obligate and dedicated role in mediating IFN-dependent biologic responses and reveal an unexpected level of physiologic specificity for STAT1 action.</p>

This flexibility is crucial for T-cell development and can have both beneficial and harmful effects on peripheral T cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that invades a wide range of vertebrate host cells. We demonstrate that invasion is critically dependent on actin filaments in the parasite, but not the host cell. Invasion into cytochalasin D (CD)-resistant host cells was blocked by CD, while parasite mutants invaded wild-type host cells in the presence of drug. CD resistance in Toxoplasma was mediated by a point mutation in the single-copy actin gene ACT1. Transfection of the mutant act1 allele into wild-type Toxoplasma conferred motility and invasion in the presence of CD. We conclude that host cell invasion by Toxoplasma, and likely by related Apicomplexans, is actively powered by an actin-based contractile system in the parasite.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed 14-3-3 family of proteins bind to a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. The nature and specificity of 14-3-3 binding is, however, not known. Here we show that 14-3-3 is a specific phosphoserine-binding protein. Using a panel of phosphorylated peptides based on Raf-1, we have defined the 14-3-3 binding motif and show that most of the known 14-3-3 binding proteins contain the motif. Peptides containing the motif could disrupt 14-3-3 complexes and inhibit maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes. These results suggest that the interactions of 14-3-3 with signaling proteins are critical for the activation of signaling proteins. Our findings also suggest novel roles for serine/threonine phosphorylation in the assembly of protein-protein complexes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The genetic background of T lymphocytes influences development of the T helper (TH) phenotype, resulting in either resistance or susceptibility of certain mouse strains to pathogens such as Leishmania major. With an in vitro model system, a difference in maintenance of responsiveness of T cells to interleukin-12 (IL-12) was detected between BALB/c and B10.D2 mice. Although naive T cells from both strains initially responded to IL-12, BALB/c T cells lost IL-12 responsiveness after stimulation with antigen in vitro, even when cocultured with B10.D2 T cells. Thus, susceptibility of BALB/c mice to infection with L. major may derive from the loss of the ability to generate IL-12-induced TH1 responses rather than from an IL-4-induced TH2 response.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Ions are not traditionally thought to act as first messengers in signal transduction cascades. However, while searching for genes regulated by the PhoP/PhoQ virulence regulatory system of Salmonella typhimurium, we recovered two loci whose expression is controlled by the concentration of Mg2+. To determine whether Mg2+ is the signal modulating the whole PhoP/PhoQ system, we evaluated the gene expression pattern of six PhoP-activated genes. Growth in physiological concentrations of divalent cations repressed transcription of PhoP-activated genes and rendered wild-type Salmonella phenotypically PhoP-. Mg2+ changed the conformation of the periplasmic domain of PhoQ, identifying this protein as a Mg2+ sensor. A mutation in the sensing domain of PhoQ altered the set point for Mg2+ and rendered Salmonella avirulent.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The digestive vacuole of Plasmodium falciparum is the site of hemoglobin degradation, heme polymerization into crystalline hemozoin, and antimalarial drug accumulation. Antibodies identified histidine-rich protein II (HRP II) in purified digestive vacuoles. Recombinant or native HRP II promoted the formation of hemozoin, and chloroquine inhibited the reaction. The related HRP III also polymerized heme, and an additional HRP was identified in vacuoles. It is proposed that after secretion by the parasite into the host erythrocyte cytosol, HRPs are brought into the acidic digestive vacuole along with hemoglobin. After hemoglobin proteolysis, HRPs bind the liberated heme and mediate hemozoin formation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Clathrin-coated vesicles transport selected integral membrane proteins from the cell surface and the trans-Golgi network to the endosomal system. Before fusing with their target the vesicles must be stripped of their coats. This process is effected by the chaperone protein hsp70c together with a 100K cofactor which we here identify as the coat protein auxilin. Auxilin binds with high affinity to assembled clathrin lattices and, in the presence of ATP, recruits hsp70c. Dissociation of the lattice does not depend as previously supposed on clathrin light chains or on the amino-terminal domain of the heavy chain. The presence of a J-domain at its carboxy terminus now defines auxilin as a member of the DnaJ protein family. In conjunction with hsp70, DnaJ proteins catalyse protein folding, protein transport across membranes and the selective disruption of protein-protein interactions. We show that deletion of the J-domain of auxilin results in the loss of cofactor activity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Activation of CD4+ T helper cells results from the occupancy of the T-cell receptor (TCR) by immunogenic peptide bound to a class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, together with a co-stimulatory signal from the antigen-presenting cell (APC). This activation leads to proliferation, cytokine production (Th1 or Th2 profile) and cytolysis. Engagement of the TCR in the absence of co-stimulation causes Th1 cells to become unresponsive to subsequent antigenic stimulation. We have previously demonstrated that analogues of an immunogenic peptide could stimulate Th1 and Th2 cells to carry out some effector functions without inducing proliferation, a phenomenon we term partial activation. Here we study the consequences of such partial activation through the TCR of two Th1 clones using peptide analogues presented by a live APC. A peptide analogue that is unable to stimulate clonal proliferation or production of cytokine or inositol phosphate can induce the T cells to become profoundly unresponsive to subsequent stimulation with the immunogenic peptide. Thus, altering the ligand of the TCR by using a peptide analogue on a functional APC sends a signal to Th1 clones that results in anergy.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Sets of new gene sequences from human, nematode, and yeast were compared with each other and with a set of Escherichia coli genes in order to detect ancient evolutionarily conserved regions (ACRs) in the encoded proteins. Nearly all of the ACRs so identified were found to be homologous to sequences in the protein databases. This suggests that currently known proteins may already include representatives of most ACRs and that new sequences not similar to any database sequence are unlikely to contain ACRs. Preliminary analyses indicate that moderately expressed genes may be more likely to contain ACRs than rarely expressed genes. It is estimated that there are fewer than 900 ACRs in all.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>bcl-2-/-mice complete embryonic development, but display growth retardation and early mortality postnatally. Hematopoiesis including lymphocyte differentiation is initially normal, but thymus and spleen undergo massive apoptotic involution. Thymocytes require an apoptotic signal to manifest accelerated cell death. Renal failure results from severe polycystic kidney disease characterized by dilated proximal and distal tubular segments and hyperproliferation of epithelium and interstitium. bcl-2-/-mice turn gray with the second hair follicle cycle, implicating a defect in redox-regulated melanin synthesis. The abnormalities in these loss of function mice argue that Bcl-2 is a death repressor molecule functioning in an antioxidant pathway.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A characteristic feature of early zygote development in Chlamydomonas is the selective degradation of chloroplast DNA from the mating type minus parent. The zygote-specific gene cluster ezy-1 is linked to the mating type locus and is transcribed almost immediately upon zygote formation. We show here that the acidic Ezy-1 polypeptide is rapidly transported to both the plus and minus chloroplasts, where it interacts with each chloroplast nucleoid. Expression of ezy-1 is selectively inhibited when plus, but not minus, gametes are briefly ultraviolet irradiated just prior to mating, a treatment known to disrupt the uniparental inheritance of chloroplast traits. We propose that the Ezy-1 polypeptide participates in the destruction of the minus chloroplast DNA in zygotes and thus the uniparental inheritance of chloroplast traits. The ezy-1 gene represents a valuable molecular probe for dissecting mechanisms underlying organelle inheritance.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The bcl-2 proto-oncogene can prevent the death of many cell types. Mice were generated that were chimeric for the homozygous inactivation of bcl-2. Lymphocytes without Bcl-2 differentiated into phenotypically mature cells. However, in vitro, the mature T cells that lacked Bcl-2 had shorter life-spans and increased sensitivity to glucocorticoids and gamma-irradiation. In contrast, stimulation of CD3 inhibited the death of these cells. T and B cells with no Bcl-2 disappeared from the bone marrow, thymus, and periphery by 4 weeks of age. Thus, Bcl-2 was dispensable for lymphocyte maturation, but was required for a stable immune system after birth.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The CD8 alpha cytoplasmic domain associates with p56lck, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase. The biological relevance of CD8 alpha-Lck association in T cell development was tested with transgenic mice generated to express a CD8 alpha molecule with two amino acid substitutions in its cytoplasmic domain, which abolishes the association of CD8 alpha with Lck. The CD8 alpha mutant was analyzed in a CD8-/- background and in the context of the transgenic 2C T cell receptor. The development and function of CD8+ T cells in these mice were apparently normal. Thus, CD8 alpha-Lck association is not necessary for positive selection, negative selection, or CD8-dependent cytotoxic function.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Bcl-2 protein is able to repress a number of apoptotic death programs. To investigate the mechanism of Bcl-2's effect, we examined whether Bcl-2 interacted with other proteins. We identified an associated 21 kd protein partner, Bax, that has extensive amino acid homology with Bcl-2, focused within highly conserved domains I and II. Bax is encoded by six exons and demonstrates a complex pattern of alternative RNA splicing that predicts a 21 kd membrane (alpha) and two forms of cytosolic protein (beta and gamma). Bax homodimerizes and forms heterodimers with Bcl-2 in vivo. Overexpressed Bax accelerates apoptotic death induced by cytokine deprivation in an IL-3-dependent cell line. Overexpressed Bax also counters the death repressor activity of Bcl-2. These data suggest a model in which the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax determines survival or death following an apoptotic stimulus.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The primary motor cortex (M1) is thought to control movements of different body parts from somatotopically organized cortical territories. Electrical stimulation suggests, however, that territories controlling different fingers overlap. Such overlap might be artifactual or else might indicate that activation of M1 to produce a finger movement occurs over a more widespread cortical area than usually assumed. These possibilities were distinguished in monkeys moving different fingers. Recordings showed that single M1 neurons were active with movements of different fingers. Neuronal populations active with movements of different fingers overlapped extensively. Control of any finger movement thus appears to utilize a population of neurons distributed throughout the M1 hand area rather than a somatotopically segregated population.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The success of Mycobacterium species as pathogens depends on their ability to maintain an infection inside the phagocytic vacuole of the macrophage. Although the bacteria are reported to modulate maturation of their intracellular vacuoles, the nature of such modifications is unknown. In this study, vacuoles formed around Mycobacterium avium failed to acidify below pH 6.3 to 6.5. Immunoelectron microscopy of infected macrophages and immunoblotting of isolated phagosomes showed that Mycobacterium vacuoles acquire the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1, but not the vesicular proton-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) responsible for phagosomal acidification. This suggests either a selective inhibition of fusion with proton-ATPase-containing vesicles or a rapid removal of the complex from Mycobacterium phagosomes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) is induced by a defective murine leukemia virus and has many symptoms similar to those found in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The presence of both B cells and CD4+ T cells is critical for the development of the disease. Furthermore, a Th2 cytokine response dominates during the progression of the disease. When interleukin-4 (IL-4)-deficient mice that are defective in Th2 cytokine responses were infected, there was no lethality, and the development of the T cell abnormalities associated with MAIDS was delayed. These data suggest that IL-4 or a Th2 response is involved in the development of retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency in mice.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Myosins are actin-activated ATPases that are able to translocate along actin filaments using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. Non-muscle cells contain conventional myosins, which are similar in sequence and structure to muscle myosin, and a number of unconventional myosins whose head sequences are similar but tail sequences are unrelated to conventional myosins. The myosin superfamily currently consists of nine classes; Drosophila 95F is an unconventional myosin and the original member of class VI, which includes a homologue found in pig kidney. Some unconventional myosins have been suggested as mediators of some types of intracellular transport, but there is little direct evidence for this function (but see ref. 6). We have observed transport of cytoplasmic particles in live Drosophila embryos in three dimensions using computational optical sectioning microscopy. We present here evidence that this transport is actin-based, ATP-dependent and catalysed by one such unconventional myosin, the 95F myosin. This is, to our knowledge, the first direct observation of transport catalysed by an unconventional myosin in living cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Bcl-2 was isolated from the t(14;18) chromosomal breakpoint in follicular B-cell lymphoma. Bcl-2 has the unique oncogenic role of extending cell survival by inhibiting a variety of apoptotic deaths. An emerging family of Bcl-2-related proteins share two highly conserved regions referred to here as Bcl-2 homology 1 and 2 (BH1 and BH2) domains (Fig. 1). This includes Bax which heterodimerizes with Bcl-2 and when overexpressed counteracts Bcl-2. We report here that site-specific mutagenesis of Bcl-2 establishes the two domains as novel dimerization motifs. Substitution of Gly 145 in BH1 domain or Trp 188 in BH2 domain completely abrogated Bcl-2's death-repressor activity in interleukin-3 deprivation, gamma-irradiation and glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Mutations that affected Bcl-2's function also disrupted its heterodimerization with Bax, yet still permitted Bcl-2 homodimerization. These results establish a functional role for the BH1 and BH2 domains and suggest Bcl-2 exerts its action through heterodimerization with Bax.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A predictive rule for protein folding is presented that involves two recurrent glycine-based motifs that cap the carboxyl termini of alpha helices. In proteins, helices that terminated in glycine residues were found predominantly in one of these two motifs. These glycine structures had a characteristic pattern of polar and apolar residues. Visual inspection of known helical sequences was sufficient to distinguish the two motifs from each other and from internal glycines that fail to terminate helices. These glycine motifs--in which the local sequence selects between available structures--represent an example of a stereochemical rule for protein folding.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Mice rendered deficient in lymphotoxin (LT) by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells have no morphologically detectable lymph nodes or Peyer's patches, although development of the thymus appears normal. Within the white pulp of the spleen, there is failure of normal segregation of B and T cells. Spleen and peripheral blood contain CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ T cells in a normal ratio, and both T cells subsets have an apparently normal lytic function. Lymphocytes positive for immunoglobulin M are present in increased numbers in both the spleen and peripheral blood. These data suggest an essential role for LT in the normal development of peripheral lymphoid organs.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The crystal structure of a ternary protein complex has been determined at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The complex is composed of three electron transfer proteins from Paracoccus denitrificans, the quinoprotein methylamine dehydrogenase, the blue copper protein amicyanin, and the cytochrome c551i. The central region of the c551i is folded similarly to several small bacterial c-type cytochromes; there is a 45-residue extension at the amino terminus and a 25-residue extension at the carboxyl terminus. The methylamine dehydrogenase-amicyanin interface is largely hydrophobic, whereas the amicyanin-cytochrome interface is more polar, with several charged groups present on each surface. Analysis of the simplest electron transfer pathways between the redox partners points out the importance of other factors such as energetics in determining the electron transfer rates.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The mating-type locus of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exists as two apparent alleles (mt+ and mt-) that control mating in haploid gametes and sporulation and meiosis in diploid mt+/mt- zygotes. Twelve genes, seven unrelated to life cycle transitions, are tightly linked to mt, suggesting that the locus exerts recombinational suppression. A 1.1 Mb chromosome walk from a gene linked to mt demonstrates that the mt+ and mt- loci carry four intrachromosomal translocations, two inversions, and large deletions and duplications within a 190 kb sector, presumably accounting for the recombinational suppression that extends through 640 kb of flanking homologous DNA. The rearranged domain also carries blocks of mt(+)- and mt(-)-specific sequences, at least one of which includes a mt(+)-specific gene. The locus has the properties of an incipient sex chromosome.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Long-term potentiation (LTP) refers to a persisting enhancement of neurotransmission that follows high-frequency activation of certain synapses. Although both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms contribute to LTP, it is believed that the enhanced release of neurotransmitter that accompanies this process results from the production of a diffusible messenger in postsynaptic neurons which traverses the synaptic cleft and alters the function of presynaptic terminals. One candidate for such a messenger is arachidonic acid, a metabolite produced by phospholipase A2 which augments synaptic transmission when coupled with presynaptic stimulation. However, the effects of arachidonic acid require activation of the postsynaptic receptor for N-methyl-D-aspartate. Previously we found that platelet-activating factor (1 O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), another phospholipase A2-derived messenger, selectively enhances excitatory postsynaptic currents in hippocampal neurons by a presynaptic mechanism. We now present evidence that platelet-activating factor, acting at a receptor localized to synaptic regions, participates in LTP in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices and may serve as part of a retrograde signalling cascade.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>CD8 is either an alpha alpha homodimer or an alpha beta heterodimer, although most peripheral CD8-lineage T cells express only the CD8 alpha beta heterodimer. The physiological function of CD8 beta was elucidated with mice that were chimeric for the homozygous disruption of the CD8 beta gene. The CD8 beta-1- T cells developed normally to CD4+CD8+ stage, but did not efficiently differentiate further, which resulted in few peripheral CD8+ T cells. The number of peripheral CD8+ T cells was restored by transfer of an exogenous CD8 beta gene into CD8 beta-deficient T cells. Thus, CD8 beta is necessary for the maturation of CD8+ T cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Development of the appropriate CD4+ T helper (TH) subset during an immune response is important for disease resolution. With the use of na&#195;&#175;ve, ovalbumin-specific alpha beta T cell receptor transgenic T cell, it was found that heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes induced TH1 development in vitro through macrophage production of interleukin-12 (IL-12). Moreover, inhibition of macrophage production of IL-12 may explain the ability of IL-10 to suppress TH1 development. Murine immune responses to L. monocytogenes in vivo are of the appropriate TH1 phenotype. Therefore, this regulatory pathway may have evolved to enable innate immune cells, through interactions with microbial pathogens, to direct development of specific immunity toward the appropriate TH phenotype.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although many peptides are generated during the intracellular processing of protein antigens, only a few are selected for recognition by the immune system. The immunodominant epitope of hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) for H-2k mice is contained in a tryptic fragment of amino-acid residues 46-61 (refs 6, 7). The core of this T-cell epitope, from amino acids 52 to 61 (DYGILQINSR), contains those residues required for binding to the class II molecule I-Ak (ref. 7). Most of the naturally processed fragments recovered from I-Ak-bearing antigen-presenting cells (APCs) cultured with HEL contained this 52-61 core sequence, presented as a nested set of peptides with extensions at both the amino and carboxyl termini. We now compare the handling by APCs of peptides containing HEL 52-61 to establish whether there is an advantage for the APC in selecting extended peptides: different complexes between peptides and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules varied greatly in the amount of time associated with the APC, and in their immunogenic strength. This difference in persistence is one of the factors contributing to the selection and immune recognition of peptide-MHC complexes by T cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Spindle orientation controls nuclear migration and segregation during mitosis. In yeast, defects in dynein and astral microtubules lead to abnormal spindle orientation and nuclear migration. Dynactin complex is necessary for dynein-mediated vesicle motility in vitro. The major polypeptide of dynactin complex is an actin-related protein in the family Arp1. We have identified in S. cerevisiae a novel actin-related gene, ACT5, in the Arp1 family. An act5 null mutant has defects in spindle orientation and nuclear migration, as does overexpression of Act5p. The phenotype of a double mutant lacking dynein and Act5p is similar to that of single mutants. Therefore, dynactin complex is in the same pathway as dynein and may be necessary for the action of dynein in vivo.</p>

The Lewis(b) (Le(b)) blood group antigen mediates H. pylori attachment to human gastric mucosa. Soluble glycoproteins presenting the Leb antigen or antibodies to the Leb antigen inhibited bacterial binding. Gastric tissue lacking Leb expression did not bind H. pylori. Bacteria did not bind to Leb antigen substituted with a terminal GalNAc alpha 1-3 residue (blood group A determinant), suggesting that the availability of H. pylori receptors might be reduced in individuals of blood group A and B phenotypes, as compared with blood group O individuals.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Studies of T cell responses to altered peptide ligands (APLs) have provided functional evidence that a T cell receptor (TCR) can interpret subtle changes in its ligand, resulting in different phenotypic outcomes. One dramatic effect of APL stimulation with live antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is the induction of energy as opposed to proliferation. We investigated the intracellular signaling events involved in generating this unresponsiveness by comparing protein-tyrosine phosphorylation patterns after stimulation with anergy-inducing APL or the immunogenic peptide. In resting T cell clones, presentation with APL/live APC stimulated a unique pattern of TCR phospho-zeta species and a subsequent lack of association with zap70. This demonstrates that the TCR-CD3 complex can engage selective intracellular biochemical signaling pathways as a direct consequence of the nature of the ligand recognized and the initial phosphotyrosine pattern of the TCR-CD3 proteins, leading to different phenotypes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Focal application in vivo of alpha-bungarotoxin to block neurotransmission in a small region of a neuromuscular junction causes long-lasting synapse elimination at that site. In contrast, blockade of neurotransmission throughout a junction does not cause synapse elimination. These and related experiments indicate that active synaptic sites can destabilize inactive synapses in their vicinity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Inwardly rectifying potassium channels conduct ions more readily in the inward than the outward direction, an essential property for normal electrical activity. Although voltage-dependent block by internal magnesium ions may underlie inward rectification in some channels, an intrinsic voltage-dependent closure of the channel plays a contributory, or even exclusive, role in others. Here we report that, rather than being intrinsic to the channel protein, so-called intrinsic rectification of strong inward rectifiers requires soluble factors that are not Mg2+ and can be released from Xenopus oocytes and other cells. Biochemical and biophysical characterization identifies these factors as polyamines (spermine, spermidine, putrescine and cadaverine). The results suggest that intrinsic rectification results from voltage-dependent block of the channel pore by polyamines, not from a voltage sensor intrinsic to the channel protein.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>PHAS-I is a heat-stable protein (relative molecular mass approximately 12,400) found in many tissues. It is rapidly phosphorylated in rat adipocytes incubated with insulin or growth factors. Nonphosphorylated PHAS-I bound to initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) and inhibited protein synthesis. Serine-64 in PHAS-I was rapidly phosphorylated by mitogen-activated (MAP) kinase, the major insulin-stimulated PHAS-I kinase in adipocyte extracts. Results obtained with antibodies, immobilized PHAS-I, and a messenger RNA cap affinity resin indicated that PHAS-I did not bind eIF-4E when serine-64 was phosphorylated. Thus, PHAS-I may be a key mediator of the stimulation of protein synthesis by the diverse group of agents and stimuli that activate MAP kinase.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The structure of the heterodimeric flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase from Chromatium vinosum was determined at a resolution of 2.53 angstroms. It contains a glutathione reductase-like flavin-binding subunit and a diheme cytochrome subunit. The diheme cytochrome folds as two domains, each resembling mitochondrial cytochrome c, and has an unusual interpropionic acid linkage joining the two heme groups in the interior of the subunit. The active site of the flavoprotein subunit contains a catalytically important disulfide bridge located above the pyrimidine portion of the flavin ring. A tryptophan, threonine, or tyrosine side chain may provide a partial conduit for electron transfer to one of the heme groups located 10 angstroms from the flavin.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although many glial cells possess neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, little is known about glial participation in neurotransmission. To explore this issue, we recorded neuronal autaptic and glial responses from cultured hippocampal single-neuron micro-islands. Excitatory synaptic events activate rapid electrogenic glial glutamate transporter currents similar to those elicited by exogenous glutamate in other preparations. We show here that glial transporter responses may be used to sense changes in presynaptic efficacy and that glial uptake helps to remove synaptically released glutamate, thereby contributing to the termination of excitatory synaptic currents under certain conditions. These observations provide a framework for understanding the role of glia in both normal and pathological processes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The assembly of different types of virulence-associated surface fibers called pili in Gram-negative bacteria requires periplasmic chaperones. PapD is the prototype member of the periplasmic chaperone family, and the structural basis of its interactions with pilus subunits was investigated. Peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of pilus subunits bound PapD and blocked the ability of PapD to bind to the pilus adhesin PapG in vitro. The crystal structure of PapD complexed to the PapG carboxyl-terminal peptide was determined to 3.0 A resolution. The peptide bound in an extended conformation with its carboxyl terminus anchored in the interdomain cleft of the chaperone via hydrogen bonds to invariant chaperone residues Arg8 and Lys112. Main chain hydrogen bonds and contacts between hydrophobic residues in the peptide and the chaperone stabilized the complex and may play a role in determining binding specificity. Site-directed mutations in Arg8 and Lys112 abolished the ability of PapD to bind pilus subunits and mediate pilus assembly in vivo, an indication that the PapD-peptide crystal structure is a reflection of at least part of the PapD-subunit interaction.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Synapse formation requires a complex interchange of information between the pre- and postsynaptic partners. At the skeletal neuromuscular junction, some of this information is contained in the basal lamina (BL), which runs through the synaptic cleft between the motor nerve terminal and the muscle fibre. During regeneration following injury, components of synaptic BL can trigger several features of postsynaptic differentiation in the absence of the nerve terminal, and of presynaptic differentiation in the absence of the muscle fibre. One nerve-derived component of synaptic BL, agrin, is known to affect postsynaptic differentiation, but no muscle-derived components have yet been shown to influence motor nerve terminals. A candidate for such a role is s-laminin (also called laminin beta 2), a homologue of the B1 (beta 1) chain of the widely distributed BL glycoprotein, laminin. s-Laminin is synthesized by muscle cells and concentrated in synaptic BL. In vitro, recombinant s-laminin fragments are selectively adhesive for motor neuron-like cells, inhibit neurite outgrowth promoted by other matrix molecules, and act as a 'stop signal' for growing neurites. By generating and characterizing mice with a targeted mutation of the s-laminin gene, we show here that s-laminin regulates formation of motor nerve terminals.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>bcl-x is a member of the bcl-2 gene family, which may regulate programmed cell death. Mice were generated that lacked Bcl-x. The Bcl-x-deficient mice died around embryonic day 13. Extensive apoptotic cell death was evident in postmitotic immature neurons of the developing brain, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. Hematopoietic cells in the liver were also apoptotic. Analyses of bcl-x double-knockout chimeric mice showed that the maturation of Bcl-x-deficient lymphocytes was diminished. The life-span of immature lymphocytes, but not mature lymphocytes, was shortened. Thus, Bcl-x functions to support the viability of immature cells during the development of the nervous and hematopoietic systems.</p>

Overexpressed ARF6 localized to the cell periphery and led to a redistribution of transferrin receptors to the cell surface and a decrease in the rate of uptake of transferrin. Similar results were obtained when a mutant defective in guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis was expressed. Expression of a dominant negative mutant, ARF6(T27N), resulted in an intracellular distribution of transferrin receptors and an inhibition of transferrin recycling to the cell surface. In contrast, overexpression of ARF1 had little or no effect on these parameters of endocytosis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>To extend the mammalian cell death pathway, we screened for further Bcl-2 interacting proteins. Both yeast two-hybrid screening and lambda expression cloning identified a novel interacting protein, Bad, whose homology to Bcl-2 is limited to the BH1 and BH2 domains. Bad selectively dimerized with Bcl-xL as well as Bcl-2, but not with Bax, Bcl-xs, Mcl-1, A1, or itself. Bad binds more strongly to Bcl-xL than Bcl-2 in mammalian cells, and it reversed the death repressor activity of Bcl-xL, but not that of Bcl-2. When Bad dimerized with Bcl-xL, Bax was displaced and apoptosis was restored. When approximately half of Bax was heterodimerized, death was inhibited. The susceptibility of a cell to a death signal is determined by these competing dimerizations in which levels of Bad influence the effectiveness of Bcl-2 versus Bcl-xL in repressing death.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of brain blood flow were used to monitor changes in the human primary and secondary somatosensory cortices during the period when somatosensory stimuli were expected. In anticipation of either focal or innocuous touching, or localized, painful shocks, blood flow decreased in parts of the primary somatosensory cortex map located outside the representation of the skin area that was the target of the expected stimulus. Specifically, attending to an impending stimulus to the fingers produced a significant decrease in blood flow in the somatosensory zones for the face, whereas attending to stimulation of the toe produced decreases in the zones for the fingers and face. Decreases were more prominent in the side ipsilateral to the location of the expected stimulus. No significant changes in blood flow occurred in the region of the cortex representing the skin locus of the awaited stimulation. These results are concurrent with a model of spatial attention in which potential signal enhancement may rely on generalized suppression of background activity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Actin assembly is important for cell motility, but the mechanism of assembly and how it relates to motility in vivo is largely unknown. In vitro, actin assembly can be controlled by proteins, such as capping protein, that bind filament ends. To investigate the function of actin assembly in vivo, we altered the levels of capping protein in Dictyostelium cells and found changes in resting and chemoattractant-induced actin assembly that were consistent with the in vitro properties of capping protein in capping but not nucleation. Significantly, overexpressers moved faster and underexpressers moved slower than control cells. Mutants also exhibited changes in cytoskeleton architecture. These results provide insights into in vivo actin assembly and the role of the actin cytoskeleton in motility.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The effects of neurotrophins on several forms of neuronal degeneration in murine cortical cell cultures were examined. Consistent with other studies, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4/5 all attenuated the apoptotic death induced by serum deprivation or exposure to the calcium channel antagonist nimodipine. Unexpectedly, however, 24-hour pretreatment with these same neurotrophins markedly potentiated the necrotic death induced by exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation or N-methyl-D-aspartate. Thus, certain neurotrophins may have opposing effects on different types of death in the same neurons.</p>

Whole cell and single channel currents were blocked by charybdotoxin, iberiotoxin, and tetraethylammonium ion. A large number of variant mSlo cDNAs were isolated, indicating that several diverse mammalian BK channel types are produced by a single gene.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>During its 48-hour cycle inside the red blood cell, the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, increases its volume 25-fold and divides asexually. This rapid growth demands large amounts of nutrients, a problem exacerbated by the lower metabolic rate and relative ionic impermeability of the host red blood cell. Direct passage of small nutrients across the two membranes that separate the parasite from the erythrocyte cytosol may be important for parasite development and has been demonstrated for radiolabelled glucose, amino acids, and purine nucleosides. Flux studies on plasmodia are limited, however, to suspensions of erythrocyte-free parasites and so cannot be used to examine the individual transport properties of the two membranes involved. Here we use the cell-attached patch clamp method to overcome this limitation. After removing the intervening red blood cell membrane and forming gigaohm seals on the small (3-5 microns) parasite, we studied transport across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), the outer of the two membranes that separate the parasite from the erythrocyte cytosol. A 140-pS channel which is permeable to both cations and anions was identified on the PVM. This channel is present at high density, is open more than 98 per cent of the time at the resting potential of the PVM, and is permeable to lysine and glucuronate. The channel can readily transport amino acids and monosaccharides across the PVM and may be essential for fulfilling the parasite's metabolic demands.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules present antigens that are produced within the presenting cell or penetrate from the vacuolar system into the cytosol for processing. Most studies of exogenous antigen processing have used soluble antigens, which are not efficiently presented by class I MHC molecules and do not elicit CD8 T-cell responses in vivo. But particulate antigen preparations with no known mechanism for cytosolic penetration can also elicit CD8 T-cell responses in vivo. We report here that phagocytosis of bacteria with no mechanism for cytosolic penetration also results in presentation of bacterial antigens by class I MHC molecules. Moreover, this mechanism is resistant to cycloheximide and Brefeldin A, which block the classical class I processing pathway. These results suggest a novel vacuolar class I processing pathway for exogenous phagocytic antigens.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Of numerous synaptic components that have been identified, perhaps the best-studied are the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. AChRs are diffusely distributed on embryonic myotubes, but become highly concentrated (approximately 10,000 microns-2) in the postsynaptic membrane as development proceeds. At least two distinct processes contribute to this accumulation. One is local synthesis: subsynaptic muscle nuclei transcribe AChR subunit genes at higher rates than extra-synaptic nuclei, so AChR messenger RNA is concentrated near synaptic sites. Second, once AChRs have been inserted in the membrane, they form high-density clusters by tethering to a subsynaptic cytoskeletal complex. A key component of this complex is rapsyn, a peripheral membrane protein of relative molecular mass 43K (refs 4, 5), which is precisely colocalized with AChRs at synaptic sites from the earliest stages of neuromuscular synaptogenesis. In heterologous systems, expression of recombinant rapsyn leads to clustering of diffusely distributed AChRs, suggesting that rapsyn may control formation of clusters. To assess the role of rapsyn in vivo, we generated and characterized mutant mice with a targeted disruption of the Rapsyn gene. We report that rapsyn is essential for the formation of AChR clusters, but that synapse-specific transcription of AChR subunit genes can proceed in its absence.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>An aspartic acid residue has been introduced near ring V of the L-side accessory bacteriochlorophyll (BCHlL) or the photosynthetic reaction center in a rhodobacter capsulatus mutant in which a His also replaces Leu 212 on the M-polypeptide. The initial stage of charge separation in the G(M201)D/L(M212)H double mutant yields approximately 70 percent electron transfer to the L-side cofactors, approximately 15 percent rapid deactivation to the ground state, and approximately 15 percent electron transfer to the so-called inactive M-side bacteriopheophytin (BPhM). It is suggested here that the Asp introduced at M201 modulates the reduction potential of BCHlL, thereby changing the energetics of charge separation. The results demonstrate that an individual amino acid residue can, through its influence on the free energies of the charge-separated states, effectively dictate the balance between the forward electron transfer reactions on the L-side of the RC, the charge-recombination processes, and electron transfer to the M-side chromophores.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>During thymic development, T cells that can recognize foreign antigen in association with self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are selected for survival (positive selection) and autoreactive T cells are eliminated (negative selection). Both of these selective events are mediated by interaction between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the peptide-MHC complex. But the signalling pathways that lead to cell survival or to cell death are still unclear. ZAP-70 is a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) that is associated with the TCR signalling subunits (CD3 and zeta) and is expressed in T cells and natural killer cells. It has been shown that ZAP-70 plays a crucial role in T-cell activation and development. Here we show that mice lacking ZAP-70 had neither CD4 nor CD8 single-positive T cells, but human ZAP-70 reconstituted both CD4 and CD8 single-positive populations. Moreover, ZAP-70-/- thymocytes were not deleted by peptide antigens. Natural killer cell function was intact in the absence of ZAP-70. These data suggest that ZAP-70 is a central signalling molecule during thymic selection for CD4 and CD8 lineage.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>T cell hybridomas require the immediate-early gene NGFI-B (nur77) for T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated apoptosis, a model for negative selection of self-reactive T cells. TCR-mediated death was examined in mice bearing an NGFI-B loss-of-function mutation, either by administration of antibodies to CD3 (anti-CD3) or in two well-characterized transgenic models expressing self-reactive TCRs. Both the extent and the rate of thymocyte death were unimpaired. Anti-CD3-induced death was normal in CD4+ peripheral T cells, in which death is mediated predominantly by the Fas signaling pathway. Thus, no unique requirement for NGFI-B is observed for thymic or peripheral T cell death.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The basal lamina that ensheaths skeletal muscle fibers traverses the synaptic cleft at the neuromuscular junction. Synaptic and extrasynaptic portions of the basal lamina contain different laminin beta chains: beta 2 (or s) at synapses and beta 1 (or B1) extrasynaptically. Laminin beta 2 is also confined to synapselike patches on myotube surfaces in vitro, whereas beta 1 is present throughout the extracellular matrix. This differential localization of laminin beta chains was analyzed by expression of chimeric beta 1-beta 2 molecules in cultured mouse myotubes. A 16-amino acid carboxyl-terminal sequence in beta 2 was necessary for synaptic localization, and an amino-terminal domain in beta 1 promoted association with extracellular fibrils. The synaptic targeting sequence of beta 2 contains a site previously shown to be adhesive for motor neurons.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor protein (Rb) belongs to a family that share a motif known as the pocket. The pocket was originally identified as the region of Rb required for binding to oncoproteins from DNA tumour viruses, which disrupt the binding of Rb to the E2F family of cell-cycle transcription factors (referred to collectively here as E2F). Rb switches E2F sites from positive to negative elements, suggesting that Rb-E2F is an active complex that blocks transcription. Here we report that Rb is selectively recruited to promoters through E2F, where it in turn inactivates surrounding transcription factors by blocking their interaction with the basal transcription complex. We suggest that this repressor activity is essential for inhibiting promoters that contain enhancers in addition to E2F sites.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>During stress, the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is changed in a global fashion, leading to an increase in cardiovascular function and a release of adrenal catecholamines. This response is thought to be regulated by a common set of brain neurons that provide a dual input to the sympathetic preganglionic neurons regulating cardiac and adrenal medullary functions. By using a double-virus transneuronal labeling technique, the existence of such a set of central autonomic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem was demonstrated. These neurons innervate both of the sympathetic outflow systems and likely function in circumstances where parallel sympathetic processing occurs, such as in the fight-or-flight response.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>BAX, a heterodimeric partner of BCL2, counters BCL2 and promotes apoptosis in gain-of-function experiments. A Bax knockout mouse was generated that proved viable but displayed lineage-specific aberrations in cell death. Thymocytes and B cells in this mouse displayed hyperplasia, and Bax-deficient ovaries contained unusual atretic follicles with excess granulosa cells. In contrast, Bax-deficient males were infertile as a result of disordered seminiferous tubules with an accumulation of atypical premeiotic germ cells, but no mature haploid sperm. Multinucleated giant cells and dysplastic cells accompanied massive cell death. Thus, the loss of Bax results in hyperplasia or hypoplasia, depending on the cellular context.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>It is often argued that substantially more carbon dioxide and water were degassed from the martian interior than can be found at present in the atmosphere, polar caps and regolith. Calculations have shown that atmospheric escape cannot account for all of the missing volatiles. Suggestions that carbon dioxide is stored as marine or lacustrine deposits, are challenged by Earth-based and spacecraft remote-sensing data. Moreover, recent modelling of the martian atmosphere suggests that rainfall or open bodies of water are in any case unlikely to have persisted for extended periods of time. Hydrothermal carbonates therefore provide a possible solution to this dilemma. Using an accessible terrestrial system (Iceland) as a guide to the underlying processes, and a host rock composition inferred from the least-altered martian meteorite, we present a geochemical model for the formation of carbonates in possible martian hydrothermal systems. Our results suggest that an extensive reservoir of carbonate minerals--equivalent to an atmospheric pressure of carbon dioxide of at least one bar--could have been sequestered beneath the surface by widespread hydrothermal activity in the martian past.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A central enigma of transcriptional regulation is how the normally efficient transcription elongation complex stops at pause and termination signals. One possibility, raised by the discovery that RNA polymerase sometimes contracts its DNA footprint, is that discontinuous movements contribute to recognizing these signals. We report that E. coli RNA polymerase responds to sequences immediately downstream and upstream from the his leader pause site by changing neither its downstream DNA contact nor its upstream RNA contact for 8 bp preceding the pause. This compressed complex isomerizes to a paused conformation by an approximately 10 bp jump of its downstream DNA contact and simultaneous extrusion of an RNA hairpin that stabilizes the paused conformation. We suggest pausing and termination could be alternative outcomes of a similar isomerization that depend on the strength of contacts to 3'-proximal RNA remaining after the jump.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) require a polysaccharide cofactor, heparin or heparan sulfate (HS), for receptor binding and activation. To probe the molecular mechanism by which heparin or HS (heparin/HS) activates FGF, small nonsulfated oligosaccharides found within heparin/HS were assayed for activity. These synthetic and isomerically pure compounds can activate the FGF signaling pathway. The crystal structures of complexes between FGF and these heparin/HS oligosaccharides reveal several binding sites on FGF and constrain possible mechanisms by which heparin/HS can activate the FGF receptor. These studies establish a framework for the molecular design of compounds capable of modulating FGF activity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Bcl-2 inhibits most types of apoptotic cell death, implying a common mechanism of lethality. Bcl-2 is localized to intracellular sites of oxygen free radical generation including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticula, and nuclear membranes. Antioxidants that scavenge peroxides, N-acetylcysteine and glutathione peroxidase, countered apoptotic death, while manganese superoxide dismutase did not. Bcl-2 protected cells from H2O2- and menadione-induced oxidative deaths. Bcl-2 did not prevent the cyanide-resistant oxidative burst generated by menadione. Two model systems of apoptosis showed no increment in cyanide-resistant respiration, and generation of endogenous peroxides continued at an inherent rate that was unaltered by Bcl-2. Following an apoptotic signal, cells sustained progressive lipid peroxidation. Overexpression of Bcl-2 functioned to suppress lipid peroxidation completely. We propose a model in which Bcl-2 regulates an antioxidant pathway at sites of free radical generation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) responsiveness in certain cells depends on the state of cellular differentiation or activation. Here an in vitro developmental system was used to show that IFN-gamma produced during generation of the CD4+ T helper cell type 1 (TH1) subset extinguishes expression of the IFN-gamma receptor beta subunit, resulting in TH1 cells that are unresponsive to IFN-gamma. This beta chain loss also occurred in IFN-gamma-treated TH2 cells and thus represents a specific response of CD4+ T cells to IFN-gamma rather than a TH1-specific differentiation event. These results define a mechanism of cellular desensitization where a cytokine down-regulates expression of a receptor subunit required primarily for signaling and not ligand binding.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Cadherins mediate cell adhesion and are essential for normal development. Embryonic stem cells were transfected with a dominant negative N-cadherin mutant (NCAD delta) under the control of promoters active in small intestinal epithelial cells and then introduced into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts. Analysis of adult chimeric mice revealed that expression of NCAD delta along the entire crypt-villus axis, but not in the villus epithelium alone, produced an inflammatory bowel disease resembling Crohn's disease. NCAD delta perturbed proliferation, migration, and death programs in crypts, which lead to adenomas. This model provides insights about cadherin function in an adult organ and the factors underlying inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal neoplasia.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The eye is a privileged site that cannot tolerate destructive inflammatory responses. Inflammatory cells entering the anterior chamber of the eye in response to viral infection underwent apoptosis that was dependent on Fas (CD95)-Fas ligand (FasL) and produced no tissue damage. In contrast, viral infection in gld mice, which lack functional FasL, resulted in an inflammation and invasion of ocular tissue without apoptosis. Fas-positive but not Fas-negative tumor cells were killed by apoptosis when placed within isolated anterior segments of the eyes of normal but not FasL-negative mice. FasL messenger RNA and protein were detectable in the eye. Thus, Fas-FasL interactions appear to be an important mechanism for the maintenance of immune privilege.</p>

Correspondingly, the time needed to detect a conjunction target increased with the number of items in the display, which is consistent with the use of a mechanism that successively analyzes each item in the visual field.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The mixed-lineage leukaemia gene (MLL/HRX/ALL-1) is disrupted by chromosomal translocation in human acute leukaemias that often display mixed lymphoid-myeloid phenotypes and present in infancy. MLL possesses a highly conserved SET domain also found in Drosophila trithorax (trx) and Polycomb group (Pc-G) genes, which are known to regulate homeotic genes (HOM-C) in a positive or negative fashion, respectively. Mll was targeted in mice by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells to assess its role in pattern development. Mll heterozygous (+/-) mice had retarded growth, displayed haematopoietic abnormalities, and demonstrated bidirectional homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton as well as sternal malformations. Mll deficiency (-/-) was embryonic lethal. Anterior boundaries of Hoxa-7 and Hoxc-9 expression were shifted posteriorly in Mll +/- embryos, but their expression was abolished in Mll -/- embryos. Thus Mll is required for proper segment identity in mammals, displays haplo-insufficiency, and positively regulates Hox gene expression.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The distribution of presynaptic endings on the surfaces of autonomic ganglion cells was mapped in living mice after intravenous administration of a styryl pyridinium dye. The staining and imaging techniques did not appear to damage the ganglion cells, or the synapses on them; these procedures could therefore be repeated after an arbitrary period. Observations of the same neurons at intervals of up to 3 weeks indicate that the pattern of preganglionic terminals on many of these nerve cells gradually changes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a trophic agent that promotes the outgrowth of nerve fibers from sympathetic and sensory ganglia. The neuronal differentiation stimulated by this hormone was examined in the NGF-responsive cell line PC12. Differential hybridization was used to screen a complementary DNA library constructed from PC12 cells treated with NGF and cycloheximide. One of the complementary DNA clones that was rapidly induced by NGF was found to have a nucleotide sequence that predicts a 54-kilodalton protein with homology to transcriptional regulatory proteins. This clone, NGFI-A, contains three tandemly repeated copies of the 28- to 30-amino acid "zinc finger" domain present in Xenopus laevis TFIIIA and other DNA-binding proteins. It also contains another highly conserved unit of eight amino acids that is repeated at least 11 times. The NGFI-A gene is expressed at relatively high levels in the brain, lung, and superior cervical ganglion of the adult rat.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum accumulate significantly less chloroquine than susceptible parasites, and this is thought to be the basis of their resistance. However, the reason for the lower accumulation of chloroquine was unknown. The resistant parasite has now been found to release chloroquine 40 to 50 times more rapidly than the susceptible parasite, although their initial rates of chloroquine accumulation are the same. Verapamil and two other calcium channel blockers, as well as vinblastine and daunomycin, each slowed the release and increased the accumulation of chloroquine by resistant (but not susceptible) Plasmodium falciparum. These results suggest that a higher rate of chloroquine release explains the lower chloroquine accumulation, and thus the resistance observed in resistant Plasmodium falciparum.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The formation of a dynamic tubulovesicular membrane network that resembles the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been observed in extracts of cultured chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF cells) using video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy. Initially, membranes in the CEF extracts appeared amorphous and aggregated, but with time, membrane tubules moved out along stationary microtubules. The membrane tubules formed new branches on intersecting microtubules and fused with other branches to form a network of interconnected polygons. The tubulovesicular network was solubilized by detergent and took on a beaded morphology in a hypotonic buffer. Formation of the tubulovesicular network required ATP and microtubules. The network did not contain elements of the plasma membrane, Golgi apparatus, or mitochondria but could be labeled with ER markers. We suggest that the tubulovesicular network contains components from the ER and is formed by membrane associated motors moving upon microtubules in a process we call microtubule-dependent tethering.</p>

These local computations are integrated in the performance of cognitive tasks such as reading. To support this general hypothesis, new data from neural imaging studies of word reading are related to results of studies on normal subjects and patients with lesions. Further support comes from studies in mental imagery, timing, and memory.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A central hypothesis in transplantation biology is that resident leukocytes expressing class II histocompatibility antigens may determine the immunogenicity of an organ. By means of a novel method to deplete the kidney of resident leukocytes, essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), this hypothesis was tested in an intact, vascular organ. Kidneys subjected to EFAD and thus depleted of resident Ia-positive macrophages survived and functioned when transplanted across a major histocompatibility antigen barrier in the absence of immunosuppression of the recipient. Control allografts were rejected promptly. Allografts from donors subjected to EFAD normalized their lipid composition and were repopulated with host macrophages by 5 days. Administration of Ia-positive cells at the time of transplantation established that the resident leukocyte depletion induced by EFAD was responsible for the protective effect. These observations may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying tissue immunogenicity and the population of normal tissues with resident leukocytes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The T-cell repertoire found in the periphery is thought to be shaped by two developmental events in the thymus that involve the antigen receptors of T lymphocytes. First, interactions between T cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules select a T-cell repertoire skewed towards recognition of antigens in the context of self-MHC molecules. In addition, T cells that react strongly to self-MHC molecules are eliminated by a process called self-tolerance. We have recently described transgenic mice expressing the alpha beta T-cell receptor from the cytotoxic T lymphocyte 2C (ref. 11). The clone 2C was derived from a BALB.B (H-2b) anti-BALB/c (H-2d) mixed lymphocyte culture and is specific for the Ld class I MHC antigen. In transgenic H-2b mice, a large fraction of T cells in the periphery expressed the 2C T-cell receptor. These T cells were predominantly CD4-CD8+ and were able to specifically lyse target cells bearing Ld. We now report that in the periphery of transgenic mice expressing Ld, functional T cells bearing the 2C T-cell receptor were deleted. This elimination of autoreactive T cells appears to take place at or before the CD4+CD8+ stage in thymocyte development. In addition, we report that in H-2s mice, a non-autoreactive target haplotype, large numbers of CD8+ T cells bearing the 2C T-cell receptor were not found, providing strong evidence for the positive selection of the 2C T-cell receptor specificity by H-2b molecules.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The major problem in the study of T-cell development is that of tracking thymocytes of a given specificity. Recent studies have exploited natural correlations between the expression of a particular V beta gene segment and T-cell receptor (TCR) specificity. We and others (refs 5, 6 and M. Davis, personal communication) have taken an alternative approach. We have generated transgenic mice expressing the alpha beta antigen receptor from the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone 2C (ref. 7). In transgenic mice of the same haplotype as the 2C clone, the 2C TCR was expressed on 20-95% of peripheral T cells. Very few of these T cells carried the CD4 antigen; the vast majority were CD4-CD8+ and were able to lyse targets with the same specificity as the original 2C clone. These results indicate that the alpha beta heterodimer transfers specificity to recipient cells as expected from earlier studies, and that receptor specificity in T-cell repertoire selection is determined by both alpha beta heterodimer and CD4 or CD8 accessory molecules.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Brain glucose uptake, oxygen metabolism, and blood flow in humans were measured with positron emission tomography, and a resting-state molar ratio of oxygen to glucose consumption of 4.1:1 was obtained. Physiological neural activity, however, increased glucose uptake and blood flow much more (51 and 50 percent, respectively) than oxygen consumption (5 percent) and produced a molar ratio for the increases of 0.4:1. Transient increases in neural activity cause a tissue uptake of glucose in excess of that consumed by oxidative metabolism, acutely consume much less energy than previously believed, and regulate local blood flow for purposes other than oxidative metabolism.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Several enzyme complexes drive cellular movements by coupling free energy-liberating chemical reactions to the production of mechanical work. A key goal in the study of these systems is to characterize at the molecular level mechanical events associated with individual reaction steps in the catalytic cycles of single enzyme molecules. Ideally, one would like to measure movements driven by single (or a few) enzyme molecules with sufficient temporal resolution and spatial precision that these events can be directly observed. Kinesin, a force-generating ATPase involved in microtubule-based intracellular organelle transport, will drive the unidirectional movement of microscopic plastic beads along microtubules in vitro. Under certain conditions, a few (less than or equal to 10) kinesin molecules may be sufficient to drive either bead movement or organelle transport. Here we describe a method for determining precise positional information from light-microscope images. The method is applied to measure kinesin-driven bead movements in vitro with a precision of 1-2 nm. Our measurements reveal basic mechanical features of kinesin-driven movements along the microtubule lattice, and place significant constraints on possible molecular mechanisms of movement.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Just over 60 years ago, Dart's description and analysis of the Taung child's skull triggered an intellectual revolution about human origins. Recently, several authors have suggested that one of the most significant hominid-like traits of australopithecines, delayed maturation, may not after all be valid. This is a radical departure from Mann's classic study of australopithecine maturation and palaeodemography based on dental eruption patterns. The resolution of this debate has important implications for the history of the biological and social evolution of the human species. In view of the controversies generated by recent studies, and particularly because the Taung skull is the type specimen of Australopithecus africanus, we have investigated the relevant anatomy of the Taung 'child' using computerized tomography. We conclude that the Taung 'child' shows some important dental maturational affinities with great apes, although as Dart noted, other hominid-like features are clearly present.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A remarkable feature of nerve cells is the complex and variable pattern of their axonal and dendritic branches. Quantitative studies of a simple part of the nervous system in mammals provide evidence that neuronal geometry and innervation are regulated by long-term trophic interactions between neurons and their targets. This trophic linkage may explain how nerve cells adjust their function to the needs of bodies that vary markedly in size and form.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Blood coagulation can be initiated when factor VII or VIIa, a plasma protease, binds to its essential cofactor, tissue factor (TF), and proteolytically activates factors IX and X, triggering a cascade of events which eventually leads to the formation of thrombin and a fibrin clot. Plasma contains a lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) which inhibits activated factor X (Xa) directly and, in a Xa-dependent way, inhibits VII(a)/TF activity, presumably by forming a quaternary Xa/LACI/VII(a)/TF complex. Sequence analysis of complementary DNA clones has shown that LACI contains three tandemly repeated Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitory domains. To investigate the relationship between these Kunitz structures and LACI function, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to produce altered forms of LACI in which the residue at the active-site cleft of each Kunitz domain has been individually changed. The second Kunitz domain is required for efficient binding and inhibition of Xa, and both Kunitz domains 1 and 2 are required for the inhibition of VIIa/TF activity; but alteration of the active-site residue of the third Kunitz domain has no significant effect on either function. We propose that in the putative inhibitory complex, Kunitz domain 1 is bound to the active site of VII(a)/TF and that Kunitz domain 2 is bound to Xa's active site.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Sindbis virus, an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome, was engineered to express a bacterial protein, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), in cultured insect, avian, and mammalian cells. The vectors were self-replicating and gene expression was efficient and rapid; up to 10(8) CAT polypeptides were produced per infected cell in 16 to 20 hours. CAT expression could be made temperature-sensitive by means of a derivative that incorporated a temperature-sensitive mutation in viral RNA synthesis. Vector genomic RNAs were packaged into infectious particles when Sindbis helper virus was used to supply virion structural proteins. The vector RNAs were stable to at least seven cycles of infection. The expression of CAT increased about 10(3)-fold, despite a 10(15)-fold dilution during the passaging. Sindbis virus vectors should prove useful for expressing large quantities of gene products in a variety of animal cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A striking example of topographic specificity in synapse formation is the preferential reinnervation of original synaptic sites on denervated muscle fibres by regenerating motor axons. This specificity is mediated by the basal lamina of the synaptic cleft. A glycoprotein, s-laminin, has now been identified that is selectively associated with synaptic basal lamina and is recognized by motoneurons. Molecular cloning reveals that s-laminin is a novel homologue of laminin, a potent promoter of neurite outgrowth.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Antigens present during neonatal life are recognized as self and individuals are tolerant to these antigens. In normal individuals T cells are tolerant to most self proteins but we still know little of the mechanism(s) by which tolerance is established. A requisite part of the current negative selection model of self tolerance is the expression of self proteins complexed with major histocompatibility complex molecules in the thymus. As MHC proteins bind antigens and present them to the receptor on the antigen-specific T cell, then for tolerance to self to occur, it is possible that each self protein must be processed and presented by an MHC molecule. As a result of the development of a unique T-cell hybrid reactive to the self protein murine haemoglobin, we have shown that in normal animals this self protein is continuously processed and potentially presented in an MHC-restricted manner. Here we show that self haemoglobin is being processed and presented by thymic antigen-presenting cells as early as gestational day 14. We also demonstrate that three types of thymic stromal cells, namely macrophages, dendritic cells and cortical epithelial cells, can present the haemoglobin self antigen in vivo. This surprising presentation of a self antigen by thymic cortical epithelial cells implies that they could be involved in T-cell development and negative selection.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A glycoprotein purified from chick brain, of relative molecular mass 42,000, increases the rate of appearance of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on the surface of chick myotubes. RNase protection assays have shown that this AChR-inducing activity (ARIA) increases the amount of mRNA encoding the alpha-subunit of the AChR, with little or no effect on the amounts of gamma- and delta-mRNAs2. Here, we report that the mRNAs encoding the alpha- and gamma-subunits of the receptor detected by in situ hybridization are concentrated around nuclei in cultured myotubes. Consistent with previous results, ARIA selectively increased the amount of alpha-subunit mRNA, but we now find that all nuclei were not activated to the same extent, with a substantial number not responding at all. Assuming that ARIA is released by motor nerve terminals, our results indicate that only a subset of muscle nuclei are capable of contributing to the accumulation of AChRs at developing neuromuscular junctions.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A mutation in the white gene of Drosophila mauritiana resulting from insertion of the transposable element mariner exhibits genetic instability in germline and somatic cells. The instability is greatly enhanced in the presence of the trans-acting autosomal factor Mos, giving eye-color mosaics with pigmented sectors of tissue on an otherwise peach-colored background. The Mos factor, when introduced into the genome of the sibling species Drosophila simulans, exhibited a dramatic maternal effect on expression of the mosaic phenotype. When D. simulans mosaic females (heterozygous for Mos) were crossed with non-mosaic males, two distinct classes of mosaic offspring occurred, one resulting from a maternal effect in which the non-Mos offspring were nevertheless mosaic. The maternal effect was mediated by a product acting after fertilization, and was expressed to varying extents in different backcross strains.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The elastin receptor complex contains a component of 67 kilodaltons that binds to a glycoconjugate affinity column containing beta-galactoside residues and is eluted from this column with lactose. This protein component is also released from the surface of cultured chondroblasts by incubation with lactose, and its association with immobilized elastin is inhibited by lactose. Since lactose also blocks elastic fiber formation by cultured chondroblasts, the galactoside-binding property of the elastin receptor is implicated in this process.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The unc-22 gene of Caenorhabolitis elegans encodes a protein which is a component of the myosin-containing A-band of the worm's striated body-wall muscle. Among 51 revertants of a transposon-induced mutant, we have identified four which retain a barely detectable mutant phenotype. Molecular analysis shows that three of these have in-frame deletions of 1.0, 1.3 and 2.0 kilobases, whereas the fourth partial revertant and two other apparently complete revertants have small insertions. All these rearrangements involve coding sequence and, in the case of the deletions, result in polypeptides that are shorter than the wild-type protein. The region of the gene containing these rearrangements contains 10 copies of a motif recognized in other regions of the gene (our unpublished data). We suggest that one explanation for the minimally mutant phenotype associated with the deletions is that the size and the repeated nature of the unc-22 protein structure make it relatively tolerant of substitutions or deletions involving one or a small number of repeated motifs. These results could explain why in some human genetic diseases, such as Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, deletions can be associated with only mild forms of the disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The complete germline organization of the beta-chain genes of the murine T cell receptor was elucidated in order to obtain the structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of somatic DNA rearrangements. Twenty of the 22 known variable (V beta) genes are clustered within 250 kilobases of DNA 5' to the constant region (C beta) genes. These V beta genes share the same transcriptional orientation as the diversity (D beta), joining (J beta), and C beta genes, which implies that chromosomal deletion is the mechanism for most V beta to D beta-J beta rearrangements. Within this V beta cluster, the distance between the most proximal V beta gene and the D beta-J beta-C beta cluster is 320 kilobases, as determined by field-inversion gel electrophoresis. The large distance between V beta and D beta, relative to that between D beta and J beta, may have significant implications for the ordered rearrangement of the T cell receptor beta-chain genes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Many regions of the mammalian brain are characterized by iterated ensembles of nerve cells which can be distinguished anatomically and physiologically. A particularly striking example is the pattern of glomeruli in the olfactory bulbs; other instances are columns and 'blobs' in the visual cortex, barrels and columns in the somatosensory cortex, and striasomes and cell islands in the neostriatum. Understanding the generation of these neuronal ensembles has a bearing on a variety of important neurobiological problems, including the nature of critical periods, the age-dependent response of the nervous system to injury and the manner in which neural information is stored. Analysis of these issues has usually been restricted to studies of the brains of different individuals at various ages. Many questions about the formation of such units, however, can only be answered by observing the same brain repeatedly in a living animal. This strategy would enable a direct assessment of how these units are assembled, whether the initial ensembles persist and whether units are lost or gained as an animal matures. We have succeeded in studying the pattern of glomeruli in the mouse olfactory bulb on two separate occasions during postnatal development. Comparison of the patterns observed at intervals of up to three weeks show that this part of the brain is gradually constructed by the addition of new glomeruli to a persisting population.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In B6AF1 mice, T lymphocytes that use the V beta 11-positive (and not V beta 6-positive or V beta 8-positive) segment in their receptor for antigen are greatly reduced in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid tissues, most likely as a result of clonal deletion. The relative number of V beta 11-positive cells in adult lymph nodes was ten times as high in B6AF1 mice thymectomized 1 to 4 days after birth as in normal mice. Moreover, for the first 10 days of life of B6AF1 mice, mature V beta 11-positive T cells were readily detected in the thymus and spleen. Thus neonatal thymectomy results in the maintenance of the receptor repertoire of early postnatal life, and this correlates with the subsequent development of organ-specific autoimmune diseases.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Several recent studies have suggested that interactions between thymocytes and thymic stromal cells are essential for the development and elimination of antigen-reactive T lymphocytes. It is important, therefore, to characterize the stromal cells involved in presentation of antigen in the thymus. In a previous report, we demonstrated, using T-cell hybridomas, that three distinct types of antigen presenting cells in the thymus (cortical epithelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells) constitutively expressed self haemoglobin/Ia complexes. Here we report that one of these cell types, the cortical epithelial cell, does not induce stimulation of T-lymphocyte clones even though the antigen/Ia complex required for antigen-specific recognition is present. This lack of response occurs with both TH1 and TH2 clones. Responsiveness of the TH2 clone can be restored by adding the murine lymphokine interleukin-1 beta to the culture system.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Positron emission tomographic measurements of regional blood flow, a marker of local neuronal activity, were used to investigate the neuroanatomical correlates of a normal emotion. Healthy volunteers were studied before, during, and after anticipation of a painful electric shock. During anticipatory anxiety, there were significant blood flow increases in bilateral temporal poles, the same regions recently implicated in a lactate-induced anxiety attack in patients with panic disorder. Thus, the temporal poles seem to be involved in normal and pathological forms of human anxiety.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Proteins from Drosophila nuclei that bind to regions of alternating C and T residues present in the promoters of the heat shock genes hsp70 and hsp26 and the histone genes his3 and his4 have been purified. These proteins bind to isolated linear DNA, and genomic footprinting analyses indicate that they are bound to DNA in nuclei. In supercoiled plasmids at low pH, some of these DNA sequences adopt triple-helical structures which, if they form in vivo, could significantly affect chromatin structure. The nuclear proteins described here, and not necessarily the deformed conformation of the DNA, may be responsible for maintaining a potentially inducible promoter structure before transcriptional activation.</p>

We show here that the same N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor that catalyses the vesicle-mediated transport within Golgi stacks is also required for endocytic vesicle fusion. Thus, it is likely that a common mechanism for vesicle fusion exists for both the secretory and endocytic pathways of eukaryotic cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Accurate sequence and assembly of genomes is a critical first step for studies of genetic variation. We generated a high-quality assembly of the gorilla genome using single-molecule, real-time sequence technology and a string graph de novo assembly algorithm. The new assembly improves contiguity by two to three orders of magnitude with respect to previously released assemblies, recovering 87% of missing reference exons and incomplete gene models. Although regions of large, high-identity segmental duplications remain largely unresolved, this comprehensive assembly provides new biological insight into genetic diversity, structural variation, gene loss, and representation of repeat structures within the gorilla genome. The approach provides a path forward for the routine assembly of mammalian genomes at a level approaching that of the current quality of the human genome.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The New Horizons mission has provided resolved measurements of Pluto's moons Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. All four are small, with equivalent spherical diameters of ~40 kilometers for Nix and Hydra and ~10 kilometers for Styx and Kerberos. They are also highly elongated, with maximum to minimum axis ratios of ~2. All four moons have high albedos (~50 to 90%) suggestive of a water-ice surface composition. Crater densities on Nix and Hydra imply surface ages of at least 4 billion years. The small moons rotate much faster than synchronous, with rotational poles clustered nearly orthogonal to the common pole directions of Pluto and Charon. These results reinforce the hypothesis that the small moons formed in the aftermath of a collision that produced the Pluto-Charon binary.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Expansions of a hexanucleotide repeat (GGGGCC) in the noncoding region of the C9orf72 gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Decreased expression of C9orf72 is seen in expansion carriers, suggesting that loss of function may play a role in disease. We found that two independent mouse lines lacking the C9orf72 ortholog (3110043O21Rik) in all tissues developed normally and aged without motor neuron disease. Instead, C9orf72 null mice developed progressive splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy with accumulation of engorged macrophage-like cells. C9orf72 expression was highest in myeloid cells, and the loss of C9orf72 led to lysosomal accumulation and altered immune responses in macrophages and microglia, with age-related neuroinflammation similar to C9orf72 ALS but not sporadic ALS human patient tissue. Thus, C9orf72 is required for the normal function of myeloid cells, and altered microglial function may contribute to neurodegeneration in C9orf72 expansion carriers.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system (CNS-PNETs) are highly aggressive, poorly differentiated embryonal tumors occurring predominantly in young children but also affecting adolescents and adults. Herein, we demonstrate that a significant proportion of institutionally diagnosed CNS-PNETs display molecular profiles indistinguishable from those of various other well-defined CNS tumor entities, facilitating diagnosis and appropriate therapy for patients with these tumors. From the remaining fraction of CNS-PNETs, we identify four new CNS tumor entities, each associated with a recurrent genetic alteration and distinct histopathological and clinical features. These new molecular entities, designated "CNS neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS NB-FOXR2)," "CNS Ewing sarcoma family tumor with CIC alteration (CNS EFT-CIC)," "CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration (CNS HGNET-MN1)," and&#194;&#160;"CNS high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration (CNS HGNET-BCOR)," will enable meaningful clinical trials and the development of therapeutic strategies for patients affected by poorly differentiated CNS tumors.</p>

To explain how the network's neuronal properties encode time, we performed brainwide calcium imaging of groups of pacemaker neurons in vivo for 24 hours. Pacemakers exhibited daily rhythmic changes in intracellular Ca(2+) that were entrained by environmental cues and timed by molecular clocks. However, these rhythms were not synchronous, as each group exhibited its own phase of activation. Ca(2+) rhythms displayed by pacemaker groups that were associated with the morning or evening locomotor activities occurred ~4 hours before their respective behaviors. Loss of the receptor for the neuropeptide PDF promoted synchrony of Ca(2+) waves. Thus, neuropeptide modulation is required to sequentially time outputs from a network of synchronous molecular pacemakers.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Undernourished children exhibit impaired development of their gut microbiota. Transplanting microbiota from 6- and 18-month-old healthy or undernourished Malawian donors into young germ-free mice that were fed a Malawian diet revealed that immature microbiota from undernourished infants and children transmit impaired growth phenotypes. The representation of several age-discriminatory taxa in recipient animals correlated with lean body mass gain; liver, muscle, and brain metabolism; and bone morphology. Mice were cohoused shortly after receiving microbiota from healthy or severely stunted and underweight infants; age- and growth-discriminatory taxa from the microbiota of the former were able to invade that of the latter, which prevented growth impairments in recipient animals. Adding two invasive species, Ruminococcus gnavus and Clostridium symbiosum, to the microbiota from undernourished donors also ameliorated growth and metabolic abnormalities in recipient animals. These results provide evidence that microbiota immaturity is causally related to undernutrition and reveal potential therapeutic targets and agents.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Identifying interventions that more effectively promote healthy growth of children with undernutrition is a pressing global health goal. Analysis of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) from 6-month-postpartum mothers in two Malawian birth cohorts revealed that sialylated HMOs are significantly less abundant in those with severely stunted infants. To&#194;&#160;explore this association, we colonized young germ-free mice with a consortium of bacterial strains cultured from the fecal microbiota of a 6-month-old stunted Malawian infant and fed recipient animals a prototypic Malawian diet with or without purified sialylated bovine milk oligosaccharides (S-BMO). S-BMO produced a microbiota-dependent augmentation of lean body mass gain, changed bone morphology, and altered liver, muscle, and brain metabolism in ways indicative of a greater ability to utilize nutrients for anabolism. These effects were also documented in gnotobiotic piglets using the same consortium and Malawian diet. These preclinical models indicate a causal, microbiota-dependent relationship between S-BMO and growth promotion. PAPERCLIP.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Viruses that infect the intestine include major human pathogens (retroviruses, noroviruses, rotaviruses, astroviruses, picornaviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses) that constitute a serious public health problem worldwide. These viral pathogens are members of a large, complex viral community inhabiting the intestine termed "the enteric virome." Enteric viruses have intimate functional and genetic relationships with both the host and other microbial constituents that inhabit the intestine, such as the bacterial microbiota, their associated phages, helminthes, and fungi, which together constitute the microbiome. Emerging data indicate that enteric viruses regulate, and are in turn regulated by, these other microbes through a series of processes termed "transkingdom interactions." This represents a changing paradigm in intestinal immunity to viral infection. Here we review recent advances in the field and propose new ways in which to conceptualize this important area.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In developing hearts, changes in the cardiac metabolic milieu during the perinatal period redirect mitochondrial substrate preference from carbohydrates to fatty acids. Mechanisms responsible for this mitochondrial plasticity are unknown. Here, we found that PINK1-Mfn2-Parkin-mediated mitophagy directs this metabolic transformation in mouse hearts. A mitofusin (Mfn) 2 mutant lacking PINK1 phosphorylation sites necessary for Parkin binding (Mfn2 AA) inhibited mitochondrial Parkin translocation, suppressing mitophagy without impairing mitochondrial fusion. Cardiac Parkin deletion or expression of Mfn2 AA from birth, but not after weaning, prevented postnatal mitochondrial maturation essential to survival. Five-week-old Mfn2 AA hearts retained a fetal mitochondrial transcriptional signature without normal increases in fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis genes. Myocardial fatty acylcarnitine levels and cardiomyocyte respiration induced by palmitoylcarnitine were concordantly depressed. Thus, instead of transcriptional reprogramming, fetal cardiomyocyte mitochondria undergo perinatal Parkin-mediated mitophagy and replacement by mature adult mitochondria. Mitophagic mitochondrial removal underlies developmental cardiomyocyte mitochondrial plasticity and metabolic transitioning of perinatal hearts.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Many procedures in modern clinical medicine rely on the use of electronic implants in treating conditions that range from acute coronary events to traumatic injury. However, standard permanent electronic hardware acts as a nidus for infection: bacteria form biofilms along percutaneous wires, or seed haematogenously, with the potential to migrate within the body and to provoke immune-mediated pathological tissue reactions. The associated surgical retrieval procedures, meanwhile, subject patients to the distress associated with re-operation and expose them to additional complications. Here, we report materials, device architectures, integration strategies, and in vivo demonstrations in rats of implantable, multifunctional silicon sensors for the brain, for which all of the constituent materials naturally resorb via hydrolysis and/or metabolic action, eliminating the need for extraction. Continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure and temperature illustrates functionality essential to the treatment of traumatic brain injury; the measurement performance of our resorbable devices compares favourably with that of non-resorbable clinical standards. In our experiments, insulated percutaneous wires connect to an externally mounted, miniaturized wireless potentiostat for data transmission. In a separate set-up, we connect a sensor to an implanted (but only partially resorbable) data-communication system, proving the principle that there is no need for any percutaneous wiring. The devices can be adapted to sense fluid flow, motion, pH or thermal characteristics, in formats that are compatible with the body's abdomen and extremities, as well as the deep brain, suggesting that the sensors might meet many needs in clinical medicine.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Types 1 and P pili are prototypical bacterial cell-surface appendages playing essential roles in mediating adhesion of bacteria to the urinary tract. These pili, assembled by the chaperone-usher pathway, are polymers of pilus subunits assembling into two parts: a thin, short tip fibrillum at the top, mounted on a long pilus rod. The rod adopts a helical quaternary structure and is thought to play essential roles: its formation may drive pilus extrusion by preventing backsliding of the nascent growing pilus within the secretion pore; the rod also has striking spring-like properties, being able to uncoil and recoil depending on the intensity of shear forces generated by urine flow. Here, we present an atomic model of the P pilus&#194;&#160;generated from a 3.8&#194;&#160;&#195;&#133; resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction. This structure provides the molecular basis for the rod's remarkable mechanical properties and illuminates its role in pilus secretion.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Earth is home to a remarkable diversity of plant forms and life histories, yet comparatively few essential trait combinations have proved evolutionarily viable in today's terrestrial biosphere. By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Understanding how ecological communities are organized and how they change through time is critical to predicting the effects of climate change. Recent work documenting the co-occurrence structure of modern communities found that most significant species pairs co-occur less frequently than would be expected by chance. However, little is known about how co-occurrence structure changes through time. Here we evaluate changes in plant and animal community organization over geological time by quantifying the co-occurrence structure of 359,896 unique taxon pairs in 80 assemblages spanning the past 300 million years. Co-occurrences of most taxon pairs were statistically random, but a significant fraction were spatially aggregated or segregated. Aggregated pairs dominated from the Carboniferous period (307 million years ago) to the early Holocene epoch (11,700 years before present), when there was a pronounced shift to more segregated pairs, a trend that continues in modern assemblages. The shift began during the Holocene and coincided with increasing human population size and the spread of agriculture in North America. Before the shift, an average of 64% of significant pairs were aggregated; after the shift, the average dropped to 37%. The organization of modern and late Holocene plant and animal assemblages differs fundamentally from that of assemblages over the past 300 million years that predate the large-scale impacts of humans. Our results suggest that the rules governing the assembly of communities have recently been changed by human activity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major global health threat, replicates in macrophages in part by inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion, until interferon-&#206;&#179; (IFN&#206;&#179;) activates the macrophage to traffic M. tuberculosis to the lysosome. How IFN&#206;&#179; elicits this effect is unknown, but many studies suggest a role for macroautophagy (herein termed autophagy), a process by which cytoplasmic contents are targeted for lysosomal degradation. The involvement of autophagy has been defined based on studies in cultured cells where M. tuberculosis co-localizes with autophagy factors ATG5, ATG12, ATG16L1, p62, NDP52, BECN1 and LC3 (refs 2-6), stimulation of autophagy increases bacterial killing, and inhibition of autophagy increases bacterial survival. Notably, these studies reveal modest (~1.5-3-fold change) effects on M. tuberculosis replication. By contrast, mice lacking ATG5 in monocyte-derived cells and neutrophils (polymorponuclear cells, PMNs) succumb to M. tuberculosis within 30 days, an extremely severe phenotype similar to mice lacking IFN&#206;&#179; signalling. Importantly, ATG5 is the only autophagy factor that has been studied during M. tuberculosis infection in vivo and autophagy-independent functions of ATG5 have been described. For this reason, we used a genetic approach to elucidate the role for multiple autophagy-related genes and the requirement for autophagy in resistance to M. tuberculosis infection in vivo. Here we show that, contrary to expectation, autophagic capacity does not correlate with the outcome of M. tuberculosis infection. Instead, ATG5 plays a unique role in protection against M. tuberculosis by preventing PMN-mediated immunopathology. Furthermore, while Atg5 is dispensable in alveolar macrophages during M. tuberculosis infection, loss of Atg5 in PMNs can sensitize mice to M. tuberculosis. These findings shift our understanding of the role of ATG5 during M. tuberculosis infection, reveal new outcomes of ATG5 activity, and shed light on early events in innate immunity that are required to regulate disease pathology and bacterial replication.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins mediate fundamental membrane remodeling events that require stabilizing negative membrane curvature. These include endosomal intralumenal vesicle formation, HIV budding, nuclear envelope closure, and cytokinetic abscission. ESCRT-III subunits perform key roles in these processes by changing conformation and polymerizing into membrane-remodeling filaments. Here, we report the 4 angstrom resolution cryogenic electron microscopy reconstruction of a one-start, double-stranded helical copolymer composed of two different human ESCRT-III subunits, charged multivesicular body protein 1B (CHMP1B) and increased sodium tolerance 1 (IST1). The inner strand comprises "open" CHMP1B subunits that interlock in an elaborate domain-swapped architecture and is encircled by an outer strand of "closed" IST1 subunits. Unlike other ESCRT-III proteins, CHMP1B and IST1 polymers form external coats on positively curved membranes in vitro and in vivo. Our analysis suggests how common ESCRT-III filament architectures could stabilize different degrees and directions of membrane curvature.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole leads to a short-lived thermal flare. Despite extensive searches, radio follow-up observations of known thermal stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs) have not yet produced a conclusive detection. We present a detection of variable radio emission from a thermal TDF, which we interpret as originating from a newly launched jet. The multiwavelength properties of the source present a natural analogy with accretion-state changes of stellar mass black holes, which suggests that all TDFs could be accompanied by a jet. In the rest frame of the TDF, our radio observations are an order of magnitude more sensitive than nearly all previous upper limits, explaining how these jets, if common, could thus far have escaped detection.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Phencyclidine (PCP), a dissociative anesthetic and widely abused psychotomimetic drug, and MK-801, a potent PCP receptor ligand, have neuroprotective properties stemming from their ability to antagonize the excitotoxic actions of endogenous excitatory amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate. There is growing interest in the potential application of these compounds in the treatment of neurological disorders. However, there is an apparent neurotoxic effect of PCP and related agents (MK-801, tiletamine, and ketamine), which has heretofore been overlooked: these drugs induce acute pathomorphological changes in specific populations of brain neurons when administered subcutaneously to adult rats in relatively low doses. These findings raise new questions regarding the safety of these agents in the clinical management of neurodegenerative diseases and reinforce concerns about the potential risks associated with illicit use of PCP.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We screened a panel of mouse and human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against chikungunya virus and identified several with inhibitory activity against multiple alphaviruses. Passive transfer of broadly neutralizing MAbs protected mice against infection by chikungunya, Mayaro, and O'nyong'nyong alphaviruses. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, loss-of-function recombinant proteins and viruses, and multiple functional assays, we determined that broadly neutralizing MAbs block multiple steps in the viral lifecycle, including entry and egress, and bind to a conserved epitope on the B domain of the E2 glycoprotein. A 16 &#195;&#133; resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of a Fab fragment bound to CHIKV E2 B domain provided an explanation for its neutralizing activity. Binding to the B domain was associated with repositioning of the A domain of E2 that enabled cross-linking of neighboring spikes. Our results suggest that B domain antigenic determinants could be targeted for vaccine or antibody therapeutic development against multiple alphaviruses of global concern.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Cataracts reduce vision in 50% of individuals over 70 years of age and are a common form of blindness worldwide. Cataracts are caused when damage to the major lens crystallin proteins causes their misfolding and aggregation into insoluble amyloids. Using a thermal stability assay, we identified a class of molecules that bind &#206;&#177;-crystallins (cryAA and cryAB) and reversed their aggregation in vitro. The most promising compound improved lens transparency in the R49C cryAA and R120G cryAB mouse models of hereditary cataract. It also partially restored protein solubility in the lenses of aged mice in vivo and in human lenses ex vivo. These findings suggest an approach to treating cataracts by stabilizing &#206;&#177;-crystallins.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Miocene small-bodied anthropoid primates from Africa and Eurasia are generally considered to precede the divergence between the two groups of extant catarrhines&#226;&#128;&#148;hominoids (apes and humans) and Old World monkeys&#226;&#128;&#148;and are thus viewed as more primitive than the stem ape Proconsul. Here we describe Pliobates cataloniae gen. et sp. nov., a small-bodied (4 to 5 kilograms) primate from the Iberian Miocene (11.6 million years ago) that displays a mosaic of primitive characteristics coupled with multiple cranial and postcranial shared derived features of extant hominoids. Our cladistic analyses show that Pliobates is a stem hominoid that is more derived than previously described small catarrhines and Proconsul. This forces us to reevaluate the role played by small-bodied catarrhines in ape evolution and provides key insight into the last common ancestor of hylobatids (gibbons) and hominids (great apes and humans).</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Pollen grains undergo dramatic changes in cellular water potential as they deliver the male germ line to female gametes, and it has been proposed that mechanosensitive ion channels may sense the resulting mechanical stress. Here, we identify and characterize MscS-like 8 (MSL8), a pollen-specific, membrane tension-gated ion channel required for pollen to survive the hypoosmotic shock of rehydration and for full male fertility. MSL8 negatively regulates pollen germination but is required for cellular integrity during germination and tube growth. MSL8 thus senses and responds to changes in membrane tension associated with pollen hydration and germination. These data further suggest that homologs of bacterial MscS have been repurposed in eukaryotes to function as mechanosensors in multiple developmental and environmental contexts.</p>

The transgene demonstrates a lymphoid pattern of expression and uniformly results in an expanded follicular center cell population. Hyperplastic splenic follicles coalesce to form massive regions of splenic white pulp. Mice over 15 weeks of age demonstrate regional lymphadenopathy with abnormal cellular infiltrates. The expanded lymphoid compartment is composed predominantly of polyclonal B220-positive, IgM/IgD-positive B cells. Provocatively, the bcl-2-Ig transgene confers a survival advantage to a population of mature B cells assessed in vitro. bcl-2-Ig transgenic mice document a prospective role for the t(14;18) in B cell growth and the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The Pluto system was recently explored by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, making closest approach on 14 July 2015. Pluto's surface displays diverse landforms, terrain ages, albedos, colors, and composition gradients. Evidence is found for a water-ice crust, geologically young surface units, surface ice convection, wind streaks, volatile transport, and glacial flow. Pluto's atmosphere is highly extended, with trace hydrocarbons, a global haze layer, and a surface pressure near 10 microbars. Pluto's diverse surface geology and long-term activity raise fundamental questions about how small planets remain active many billions of years after formation. Pluto's large moon Charon displays tectonics and evidence for a heterogeneous crustal composition; its north pole displays puzzling dark terrain. Small satellites Hydra and Nix have higher albedos than expected.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A major mechanism by which insulin stimulates glucose transport in muscle and fat is the translocation of glucose transporters from an intracellular membrane pool to the cell surface. The existence of a distinct insulin-regulatable glucose transporter was suggested by the poor cross-reactivity between antibodies specific for either the HepG2 or rat brain glucose transporters and the rat adipocyte glucose transporter. More direct evidence was provided by the production of a monoclonal antibody (mAb 1F8) specific for the rat adipocyte glucose transporter that immunolabels a species of relative molecular mass 43,000 (43K) present only in tissues that exhibit insulin-dependent glucose transport, suggesting that this protein may be encoded by a different gene from the previously described mammalian glucose transporters. This antibody has been used to immunoprecipitate a 43K protein that was photoaffinity-labelled with cytochalasin B in a glucose displaceable way, and to immunolabel a protein in the plasma membrane of rat adipocytes, whose concentration was increased at least fivefold after cellular insulin exposure. Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of cDNAs isolated from both rat adipocyte and heart libraries that encode a protein recognized by mAb 1F8, and which has 65% sequence identity to the human HepG2 glucose transporter. This cDNA hybridizes to an mRNA present only in skeletal muscle, heart and adipose tissue. Our data indicate that this cDNA encodes a membrane protein with the characteristics of the translocatable glucose transporter expressed in insulin-responsive tissues.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Infections have been proposed as initiating factors for inflammatory disorders; however, identifying associations between defined infectious agents and the initiation of chronic disease has remained elusive. Here, we report that a single acute infection can have dramatic and long-term consequences for tissue-specific immunity. Following clearance of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, sustained inflammation and associated lymphatic leakage in the mesenteric adipose tissue deviates migratory dendritic cells to the adipose compartment, thereby preventing their accumulation in the mesenteric lymph node. As a consequence, canonical mucosal immune functions, including tolerance and protective immunity, are persistently compromised. Post-resolution of infection, signals derived from the microbiota maintain inflammatory mesentery remodeling and consequently, transient ablation of the microbiota restores mucosal immunity. Our results indicate that persistent disruption of communication between tissues and the immune system following clearance of an acute infection represents an inflection point beyond which tissue homeostasis and immunity is compromised for the long-term.

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The landforms of northern Gale crater on Mars expose thick sequences of sedimentary rocks. Based on images obtained by the Curiosity rover, we interpret these outcrops as evidence for past fluvial, deltaic, and lacustrine environments. Degradation of the crater wall and rim probably supplied these sediments, which advanced inward from the wall, infilling both the crater and an internal lake basin to a thickness of at least 75 meters. This intracrater lake system probably existed intermittently for thousands to millions of years, implying a relatively wet climate that supplied moisture to the crater rim and transported sediment via streams into the lake basin. The deposits in Gale crater were then exhumed, probably by wind-driven erosion, creating Aeolis Mons (Mount Sharp).</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The structural gene for N-myristoyl transferase (NMT1) has been cloned from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene encodes a polypeptide of 455 amino acids (Mr = 52,837) that has no identifiable significant primary sequence homology with any protein in currently available databases. Overexpression of NMT activity was achieved by means of the yeast episomal plasmid YEp24 without obvious effects on growth kinetics, cell morphology, or acylprotein metabolic labeling patterns. Insertional mutagenesis of the NMT1 locus on yeast chromosome XII caused recessive lethality, indicating that this protein acyltransferase activity is necessary for vegetative cell growth.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In social interactions among mammals, individuals are recognized by olfactory cues, but identifying the key signals among thousands of compounds remains a major challenge. To address this need, we developed a new technique, component-activity matching (CAM), to select candidate ligands that "explain" patterns of bioactivity across diverse complex mixtures. Using mouse urine from eight different sexes and strains, we identified 23 components to explain firing rates in seven of eight functional classes of vomeronasal sensory neurons. Focusing on a class of neurons selective for females, we identified a novel family of vomeronasal ligands, steroid carboxylic acids. These ligands accounted for much of the neuronal activity of urine from some female strains, were necessary for normal levels of male investigatory behavior of female scents, and were sufficient to trigger mounting behavior. CAM represents the first step toward an exhaustive characterization of the molecular cues for natural behavior in a mammalian olfactory system.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Libraries of tens of thousands of transposon mutants generated from each of four human gut Bacteroides strains, two representing the same species, were introduced simultaneously into gnotobiotic mice together with 11 other wild-type strains to generate a 15-member artificial human gut microbiota. Mice received one of two distinct diets monotonously, or both in different ordered sequences. Quantifying the abundance of mutants in different diet contexts allowed gene-level characterization of fitness determinants, niche, stability, and resilience and yielded a prebiotic (arabinoxylan) that allowed targeted manipulation of the community. The approach described is generalizable and should be useful for defining mechanisms critical for sustaining and/or approaches for deliberately reconfiguring the highly adaptive and durable relationship between the human gut microbiota and host in ways that promote wellness.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>To understand how different diets, the consumers' gut microbiota, and the enteric nervous system (ENS) interact to regulate gut motility, we developed a gnotobiotic mouse model that mimics short-term dietary changes that happen when humans are traveling to places with different culinary traditions. Studying animals transplanted with the microbiota from humans representing diverse culinary traditions and fed a sequence of diets representing those of all donors, we found that correlations between bacterial species abundances and transit times are diet dependent. However, the levels of unconjugated bile acids-generated by bacterial bile salt hydrolases (BSH)-correlated with faster transit, including during consumption of a Bangladeshi diet. Mice harboring a consortium of sequenced cultured bacterial strains from the Bangladeshi donor's microbiota and fed a Bangladeshi diet revealed that the commonly used cholekinetic spice, turmeric, affects gut motility through a mechanism that reflects bacterial BSH activity and Ret signaling in the ENS. These results demonstrate how a single food ingredient interacts with a functional microbiota trait to regulate host physiology.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Failure of T cells to protect against cancer is thought to result from lack of antigen recognition, chronic activation, and/or suppression by other cells. Using a mouse sarcoma model, we show that glucose consumption by tumors metabolically restricts T cells, leading to their dampened mTOR activity, glycolytic capacity, and IFN-&#206;&#179; production, thereby allowing tumor progression. We show that enhancing glycolysis in an antigenic "regressor" tumor is sufficient to override the protective ability of T cells to control tumor growth. We also show that checkpoint blockade antibodies against CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, which are used clinically, restore glucose in tumor microenvironment, permitting T cell glycolysis and IFN-&#206;&#179; production. Furthermore, we found that blocking PD-L1 directly on tumors dampens glycolysis by inhibiting mTOR activity and decreasing expression of glycolysis enzymes, reflecting a role for PD-L1 in tumor glucose utilization. Our results establish that tumor-imposed metabolic restrictions can mediate T cell hyporesponsiveness during cancer.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Detailed geodetic imaging of earthquake ruptures enhances our understanding of earthquake physics and associated ground shaking. The 25 April 2015 moment magnitude 7.8 earthquake in Gorkha, Nepal was the first large continental megathrust rupture to have occurred beneath a high-rate (5-hertz) Global Positioning System (GPS) network. We used GPS and interferometric synthetic aperture radar data to model the earthquake rupture as a slip pulse ~20 kilometers in width, ~6 seconds in duration, and with a peak sliding velocity of 1.1 meters per second, which propagated toward the Kathmandu basin at ~3.3 kilometers per second over ~140 kilometers. The smooth slip onset, indicating a large (~5-meter) slip-weakening distance, caused moderate ground shaking at high frequencies (&gt;1 hertz; peak ground acceleration, ~16% of Earth's gravity) and minimized damage to vernacular dwellings. Whole-basin resonance at a period of 4 to 5 seconds caused the collapse of tall structures, including cultural artifacts.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Comets harbor the most pristine material in our solar system in the form of ice, dust, silicates, and refractory organic material with some interstellar heritage. The evolved gas analyzer Cometary Sampling and Composition (COSAC) experiment aboard Rosetta's Philae lander was designed for in situ analysis of organic molecules on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Twenty-five minutes after Philae's initial comet touchdown, the COSAC mass spectrometer took a spectrum in sniffing mode, which displayed a suite of 16 organic compounds, including many nitrogen-bearing species but no sulfur-bearing species, and four compounds&#226;&#128;&#148;methyl isocyanate, acetone, propionaldehyde, and acetamide&#226;&#128;&#148;that had not previously been reported in comets.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>How and when the Americas were populated remains contentious. Using ancient and modern genome-wide data, we found that the ancestors of all present-day Native Americans, including Athabascans and Amerindians, entered the Americas as a single migration wave from Siberia no earlier than 23 thousand years ago (ka) and after no more than an 8000-year isolation period in Beringia. After their arrival to the Americas, ancestral Native Americans diversified into two basal genetic branches around 13 ka, one that is now dispersed across North and South America and the other restricted to North America. Subsequent gene flow resulted in some Native Americans sharing ancestry with present-day East Asians (including Siberians) and, more distantly, Australo-Melanesians. Putative "Paleoamerican" relict populations, including the historical Mexican Peric&#195;&#186;es and South American Fuego-Patagonians, are not directly related to modern Australo-Melanesians as suggested by the Paleoamerican Model.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In vivo pharmacology and optogenetics hold tremendous promise for dissection of neural circuits, cellular signaling, and manipulating neurophysiological systems in awake, behaving animals. Existing neural interface technologies, such as metal cannulas connected to external drug supplies for pharmacological infusions and tethered fiber optics for optogenetics, are not ideal for minimally invasive, untethered studies on freely behaving animals. Here, we introduce wireless optofluidic neural probes that combine ultrathin, soft microfluidic drug delivery with cellular-scale inorganic light-emitting diode (&#206;&#188;-ILED) arrays. These probes are orders of magnitude smaller than cannulas and allow wireless, programmed spatiotemporal control of fluid delivery and photostimulation. We demonstrate these devices in freely moving animals to modify gene expression, deliver peptide ligands, and provide concurrent photostimulation with antagonist drug delivery to manipulate mesoaccumbens reward-related behavior. The minimally invasive operation of these probes forecasts utility in other organ systems and species, with potential for broad application in biomedical science, engineering, and medicine.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Preclinical studies of viral vector-based HIV-1 vaccine candidates have previously shown partial protection against neutralization-resistant virus challenges in rhesus monkeys. In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector priming followed by purified envelope (Env) glycoprotein boosting. Rhesus monkeys primed with Ad26 vectors expressing SIVsmE543 Env, Gag, and Pol and boosted with AS01B-adjuvanted SIVmac32H Env gp140 demonstrated complete protection in 50% of vaccinated animals against a series of repeated, heterologous, intrarectal SIVmac251 challenges that infected all controls. Protective efficacy correlated with the functionality of Env-specific antibody responses. Comparable protection was also observed with a similar Ad/Env vaccine against repeated, heterologous, intrarectal SHIV-SF162P3 challenges. These data demonstrate robust protection by Ad/Env vaccines against acquisition of neutralization-resistant virus challenges in rhesus monkeys.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Skinner and colleagues (Research Article, 23 January 2015, p. 395), based on metacarpal trabecular bone structure, argue that Australopithecus africanus employed human-like dexterity for stone tool making and use 3 million years ago. However, their evolutionary and biological assumptions are misinformed, failing to refute the previously existing hypothesis that human-like manipulation preceded systematized stone tool manufacture, as indicated by the fossil record.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Understanding the diversity of human tissues is fundamental to disease and requires linking genetic information, which is identical in most of an individual's cells, with epigenetic mechanisms that could have tissue-specific roles. Surveys of DNA methylation in human tissues have established a complex landscape including both tissue-specific and invariant methylation patterns. Here we report high coverage methylomes that catalogue cytosine methylation in all contexts for the major human organ systems, integrated with matched transcriptomes and genomic sequence. By combining these diverse data types with each individuals' phased genome, we identified widespread tissue-specific differential CG methylation (mCG), partially methylated domains, allele-specific methylation and transcription, and the unexpected presence of non-CG methylation (mCH) in almost all human tissues. mCH correlated with tissue-specific functions, and using this mark, we made novel predictions of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in specific tissues. Overall, DNA methylation in several genomic contexts varies substantially among human tissues.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a growing family of immune cells that mirror the phenotypes and functions of T cells. However, in contrast to T cells, ILCs do not express acquired antigen receptors or undergo clonal selection and expansion when stimulated. Instead, ILCs react promptly to signals from infected or injured tissues and produce an array of secreted proteins termed cytokines that direct the developing immune response into one that is adapted to the original insult. The complex cross-talk between microenvironment, ILCs, and adaptive immunity remains to be fully deciphered. Only by understanding these complex regulatory networks can the power of ILCs be controlled or unleashed in order to regulate or enhance immune responses in disease prevention and therapy.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>S-laminin, a novel homolog of laminin, is concentrated in a subset of basal laminae including the basal lamina that passes between motor nerve terminals and muscle fibers at the neuromuscular junction. Here we used recombinant fragments to localize a neuronal attachment site to the C-terminal 10% of s-laminin. We then used synthetic peptides spanning the active fragment to identify the primary sequence of the adhesive site as Leu-Arg-Glu (LRE): neurons attach to an immobilized LRE-containing peptide, and soluble LRE blocks attachment of neurons to the s-laminin fragment. Whereas ciliary ganglion neurons (which normally innervate muscle fibers) adhered well both to laminin and to an s-laminin fragment, sensory and central neurons and several neuronal cell lines all adhered well to laminin but poorly to the s-laminin fragment. Together, these results define a motor neuron-selective attachment site on s-laminin.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Axon degeneration is an intrinsic self-destruction program that underlies axon loss during injury and disease. Sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing 1 (SARM1) protein is an essential mediator of axon degeneration. We report that SARM1 initiates a local destruction program involving rapid breakdown of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) after injury. We used an engineered protease-sensitized SARM1 to demonstrate that SARM1 activity is required after axon injury to induce axon degeneration. Dimerization of the Toll-interleukin receptor (TIR) domain of SARM1 alone was sufficient to induce locally mediated axon degeneration. Formation of the SARM1 TIR dimer triggered rapid breakdown of NAD(+), whereas SARM1-induced axon destruction could be counteracted by increased NAD(+) synthesis. SARM1-induced depletion of NAD(+) may explain the potent axon protection in Wallerian degeneration slow (Wld(s)) mutant mice.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The relationship between protein three-dimensional structure and function is essential for mechanism determination. Unfortunately, most techniques do not provide a direct measurement of this relationship. Structural data are typically limited to static pictures, and function must be inferred. Conversely, functional assays usually provide little information on structural conformation. We developed a single-molecule technique combining optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy that allows for both measurements simultaneously. Here we present measurements of UvrD, a DNA repair helicase, that directly and unambiguously reveal the connection between its structure and function. Our data reveal that UvrD exhibits two distinct types of unwinding activity regulated by its stoichiometry. Furthermore, two UvrD conformational states, termed "closed" and "open," correlate with movement toward or away from the DNA fork.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Axons in vertebrate peripheral nerves are ensheathed by Schwann cells. For some axons, this sheath consists of a single layer of glial cell cytoplasm and plasma membranes; for other axons, Schwann cells form multilayered myelin. Whether or not a Schwann cell makes myelin is determined by a signal from the axon, but the nature of this signal is not known. Here I show that sympathetic postganglionic axons, which are normally not myelinated, become myelinated when their calibre is increased as a result of increasing the size of the peripheral target they innervate. This result implies that axon calibre, which is known to be correlated with myelination, is in fact the crucial determinant of whether an axon becomes myelinated. Furthermore, the finding that increasing or decreasing target size causes corresponding increases or decreases in axon size indicates that axon calibre is itself regulated by retrograde signals from peripheral target tissues.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Permanent electric dipole moments are important for understanding symmetry breaking in molecular physics, control of chemical reactions, and realization of strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. However, large molecular permanent electric dipole moments are challenging to realize experimentally. We report the observation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules with bond lengths of ~100 nanometers and kilo-Debye permanent electric dipole moments that form when an ultracold ground-state cesium (Cs) atom becomes bound within the electronic cloud of an extended Cs electronic orbit. The electronic character of this hybrid class of "trilobite" molecules is dominated by degenerate Rydberg manifolds, making them difficult to produce by conventional photoassociation. We used detailed coupled-channel calculations to reproduce their properties quantitatively. Our findings may lead to progress in ultracold chemistry and strongly correlated many-body physics.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The clinical relevance of T cells in the control of a diverse set of human cancers is now beyond doubt. However, the nature of the antigens that allow the immune system to distinguish cancer cells from noncancer cells has long remained obscure. Recent technological innovations have made it possible to dissect the immune response to patient-specific neoantigens that arise as a consequence of tumor-specific mutations, and emerging data suggest that recognition of such neoantigens is a major factor in the activity of clinical immunotherapies. These observations indicate that neoantigen load may form a biomarker in cancer immunotherapy and provide an incentive for the development of novel therapeutic approaches that selectively enhance T cell reactivity against this class of antigens.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>T cell immunity directed against tumor-encoded amino acid substitutions occurs in some melanoma patients. This implicates missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. However, a systematic evaluation of these putative neoantigens as targets of antitumor immunity is lacking. Moreover, it remains unknown whether vaccination can augment such responses. We found that a dendritic cell vaccine led to an increase in naturally occurring neoantigen-specific immunity and revealed previously undetected human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-restricted neoantigens in patients with advanced melanoma. The presentation of neoantigens by HLA-A*02:01 in human melanoma was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Vaccination promoted a diverse neoantigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in terms of both TCR-&#206;&#178; usage and clonal composition. Our results demonstrate that vaccination directed at tumor-encoded amino acid substitutions broadens the antigenic breadth and clonal diversity of antitumor immunity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Maternal age is a risk factor for congenital heart disease even in the absence of any chromosomal abnormality in the newborn. Whether the basis of this risk resides with the mother or oocyte is unknown. The impact of maternal age on congenital heart disease can be modelled in mouse pups that harbour a mutation of the cardiac transcription factor gene Nkx2-5 (ref. 8). Here, reciprocal ovarian transplants between young and old mothers establish a maternal basis for the age-associated risk in mice. A high-fat diet does not accelerate the effect of maternal ageing, so hyperglycaemia and obesity do not simply explain the mechanism. The age-associated risk varies with the mother's strain background, making it a quantitative genetic trait. Most remarkably, voluntary exercise, whether begun by mothers at a young age or later in life, can mitigate the risk when they are older. Thus, even when the offspring carry a causal mutation, an intervention aimed at the mother can meaningfully reduce their risk of congenital heart disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Reduced food intake, avoiding malnutrition, can ameliorate aging and aging-associated diseases in invertebrate model organisms, rodents, primates, and humans. Recent findings indicate that meal timing is crucial, with both intermittent fasting and adjusted diurnal rhythm of feeding improving health and function, in the absence of changes in overall intake. Lowered intake of particular nutrients rather than of overall calories is also key, with protein and specific amino acids playing prominent roles. Nutritional modulation of the microbiome can also be important, and there are long-term, including inter-generational, effects of diet. The metabolic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms that mediate both improvement in health during aging to diet and genetic variation in the response to diet are being identified. These new findings are opening the way to specific dietary and pharmacological interventions to recapture the full potential benefits of dietary restriction, which humans can find difficult to maintain voluntarily.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Microbiota assembly is perturbed in children with undernutrition, resulting in persistent microbiota immaturity that is not rescued by current nutritional interventions. Evidence is accumulating that this immaturity is causally related to the pathogenesis of undernutrition and its lingering sequelae. Preclinical models in which human gut communities are replicated in gnotobiotic mice have provided an opportunity to identify and predict the effects of different dietary ingredients on microbiota structure, expressed functions, and host biology. This capacity sets the stage for proof-of-concept tests designed to deliberately shape the developmental trajectory and configurations of microbiota in children representing different geographies, cultural traditions, and states of health. Developing these capabilities for microbial stewardship is timely given the global health burden of childhood undernutrition, the effects of changing eating practices brought about by globalization, and the realization that affordable nutritious foods need to be developed to enhance our capacity to cultivate healthier microbiota in populations at risk for poor nutrition.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Our understanding of the origin of the genus Homo has been hampered by a limited fossil record in eastern Africa between 2.0 and 3.0 million years ago (Ma). Here we report the discovery of a partial hominin mandible with teeth from the Ledi-Geraru research area, Afar Regional State, Ethiopia, that establishes the presence of Homo at 2.80 to 2.75 Ma. This specimen combines primitive traits seen in early Australopithecus with derived morphology observed in later Homo, confirming that dentognathic departures from the australopith pattern occurred early in the Homo lineage. The Ledi-Geraru discovery has implications for hypotheses about the timing and place of origin of the genus Homo.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial surface receptor that triggers intracellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Recent genome-wide association studies have shown that a rare R47H mutation of TREM2 correlates with a substantial increase in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address the basis for this genetic association, we studied TREM2 deficiency in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. We found that TREM2 deficiency and haploinsufficiency augment &#206;&#178;-amyloid (A&#206;&#178;) accumulation due to a dysfunctional response of microglia, which fail to cluster around A&#206;&#178; plaques and become apoptotic. We further demonstrate that TREM2 senses a broad array of anionic and zwitterionic lipids known to associate with fibrillar A&#206;&#178; in lipid membranes and to be exposed on the surface of damaged neurons. Remarkably, the R47H mutation impairs TREM2 detection of lipid ligands. Thus, TREM2 detects damage-associated lipid patterns associated with neurodegeneration, sustaining the microglial response to A&#206;&#178; accumulation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Allelic differences between the two homologous chromosomes can affect the propensity of inheritance in humans; however, the extent of such differences in the human genome has yet to be fully explored. Here we delineate allelic chromatin modifications and transcriptomes among a broad set of human tissues, enabled by a chromosome-spanning haplotype reconstruction strategy. The resulting large collection of haplotype-resolved epigenomic maps reveals extensive allelic biases in both chromatin state and transcription, which show considerable variation across tissues and between individuals, and allow us to investigate cis-regulatory relationships between genes and their control sequences. Analyses of histone modification maps also uncover intriguing characteristics of cis-regulatory elements and tissue-restricted activities of repetitive elements. The rich data sets described here will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which cis-regulatory elements control gene expression programs.</p>

Current solutions to account for phenotypic variability include littermate and maternal controls or defined microbial consortia in gnotobiotic mice. In conventionally raised mice, the microbiome is transmitted from the dam. Here we show that microbially driven dichotomous faecal immunoglobulin-A (IgA) levels in wild-type mice within the same facility mimic the effects of chromosomal mutations. We observe in multiple facilities that vertically transmissible bacteria in IgA-low mice dominantly lower faecal IgA levels in IgA-high mice after co-housing or faecal transplantation. In response to injury, IgA-low mice show increased damage that is transferable by faecal transplantation and driven by faecal IgA differences. We find that bacteria from IgA-low mice degrade the secretory component of secretory IgA as well as IgA itself. These data indicate that phenotypic comparisons between mice must take into account the non-chromosomal hereditary variation between different breeders. We propose faecal IgA as one marker of microbial variability and conclude that co-housing and/or faecal transplantation enables analysis of progeny from different dams.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Dental enamel, a hierarchical material composed primarily of hydroxylapatite nanowires, is susceptible to degradation by plaque biofilm-derived acids. The solubility of enamel strongly depends on the presence of Mg(2+), F(-), and CO3(2-). However, determining the distribution of these minor ions is challenging. We show&#226;&#128;&#148;using atom probe tomography, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and correlative techniques&#226;&#128;&#148;that in unpigmented rodent enamel, Mg(2+) is predominantly present at grain boundaries as an intergranular phase of Mg-substituted amorphous calcium phosphate (Mg-ACP). In the pigmented enamel, a mixture of ferrihydrite and amorphous iron-calcium phosphate replaces the more soluble Mg-ACP, rendering it both harder and more resistant to acid attack. These results demonstrate the presence of enduring amorphous phases with a dramatic influence on the physical and chemical properties of the mature mineralized tissue.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is normally present at thousands of copies per cell and is packaged into several hundred higher-order structures termed nucleoids. The abundant mtDNA-binding protein TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) regulates nucleoid architecture, abundance and segregation. Complete mtDNA depletion profoundly impairs oxidative phosphorylation, triggering calcium-dependent stress signalling and adaptive metabolic responses. However, the cellular responses to mtDNA instability, a physiologically relevant stress observed in many human diseases and ageing, remain poorly defined. Here we show that moderate mtDNA stress elicited by TFAM deficiency engages cytosolic antiviral signalling to enhance the expression of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. Mechanistically, we find that aberrant mtDNA packaging promotes escape of mtDNA into the cytosol, where it engages the DNA sensor cGAS (also known as MB21D1) and promotes STING (also known as TMEM173)-IRF3-dependent signalling to elevate interferon-stimulated gene expression, potentiate type I interferon responses and confer broad viral resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that herpesviruses induce mtDNA stress, which enhances antiviral signalling and type I interferon responses during infection. Our results further demonstrate that mitochondria are central participants in innate immunity, identify mtDNA stress as a cell-intrinsic trigger of antiviral signalling and suggest that cellular monitoring of mtDNA homeostasis cooperates with canonical virus sensing mechanisms to fully engage antiviral innate immunity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Processes of melt generation and transport beneath back-arc spreading centres are controlled by two endmember mechanisms: decompression melting similar to that at mid-ocean ridges and flux melting resembling that beneath arcs. The Lau Basin, with an abundance of spreading ridges at different distances from the subduction zone, provides an opportunity to distinguish the effects of these two different melting processes on magma production and crust formation. Here we present constraints on the three-dimensional distribution of partial melt inferred from seismic velocities obtained from Rayleigh wave tomography using land and ocean-bottom seismographs. Low seismic velocities beneath the Central Lau Spreading Centre and the northern Eastern Lau Spreading Centre extend deeper and westwards into the back-arc, suggesting that these spreading centres are fed by melting along upwelling zones from the west, and helping to explain geochemical differences with the Valu Fa Ridge to the south, which has no distinct deep low-seismic-velocity anomalies. A region of low S-wave velocity, interpreted as resulting from high melt content, is imaged in the mantle wedge beneath the Central Lau Spreading Centre and the northeastern Lau Basin, even where no active spreading centre currently exists. This low-seismic-velocity anomaly becomes weaker with distance southward along the Eastern Lau Spreading Centre and the Valu Fa Ridge, in contrast to the inferred increase in magmatic productivity. We propose that the anomaly variations result from changes in the efficiency of melt extraction, with the decrease in melt to the south correlating with increased fractional melting and higher water content in the magma. Water released from the slab may greatly reduce the melt viscosity or increase grain size, or both, thereby facilitating melt transport.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Decreases in the diversity of enteric bacterial populations are observed in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Less is known about the virome in these diseases. We show that the enteric virome is abnormal in CD and UC patients. In-depth analysis of preparations enriched for free virions in the intestine revealed that CD and UC were associated with a significant expansion of Caudovirales bacteriophages. The viromes of CD and UC patients were disease and cohort specific. Importantly, it did not appear that expansion and diversification of the enteric virome was secondary to changes in bacterial populations. These data support a model in which changes in the virome may contribute to intestinal inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis. We conclude that the virome is a candidate for contributing to, or being a biomarker for, human inflammatory bowel disease and speculate that the enteric virome may play a role in other diseases.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The stem cells that maintain and repair the postnatal skeleton remain undefined. One model suggests that perisinusoidal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) give rise to osteoblasts, chondrocytes, marrow stromal cells, and adipocytes, although the existence of these cells has not been proven through fate-mapping experiments. We demonstrate here that expression of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist gremlin 1 defines a population of osteochondroreticular (OCR) stem cells in the bone marrow. OCR stem cells self-renew and generate osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and reticular marrow stromal cells, but not adipocytes. OCR stem cells are concentrated within the metaphysis of long bones not in the perisinusoidal space and are needed for bone development, bone remodeling, and fracture repair. Grem1 expression also identifies intestinal reticular stem cells (iRSCs) that are cells of origin for the periepithelial intestinal mesenchymal sheath. Grem1 expression identifies distinct connective tissue stem cells in both the bone (OCR stem cells) and the intestine (iRSCs).</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Our understanding of when and how humans adapted to living on the Tibetan Plateau at altitudes above 2000 to 3000 meters has been constrained by a paucity of archaeological data. Here we report data sets from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau indicating that the first villages were established only by 5200 calendar years before the present (cal yr B.P.). Using these data, we tested the hypothesis that a novel agropastoral economy facilitated year-round living at higher altitudes since 3600 cal yr B.P. This successful subsistence strategy facilitated the adaptation of farmers-herders to the challenges of global temperature decline during the late Holocene.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Variation in vectorial capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito species is determined by many factors, including behavior, immunity, and life history. To investigate the genomic basis of vectorial capacity and explore new avenues for vector control, we sequenced the genomes of 16 anopheline mosquito species from diverse locations spanning ~100 million years of evolution. Comparative analyses show faster rates of gene gain and loss, elevated gene shuffling on the X chromosome, and more intron losses, relative to Drosophila. Some determinants of vectorial capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show elevated turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes. This dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may contribute to their flexible capacity to take advantage of new ecological niches, including adapting to humans as primary hosts.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The skin represents the primary interface between the host and the environment. This organ is also home to trillions of microorganisms that play an important role in tissue homeostasis and local immunity. Skin microbial communities are highly diverse and can be remodelled over time or in response to environmental challenges. How, in the context of this complexity, individual commensal microorganisms may differentially modulate skin immunity and the consequences of these responses for tissue physiology remains unclear. Here we show that defined commensals dominantly affect skin immunity and identify the cellular mediators involved in this specification. In particular, colonization with Staphylococcus epidermidis induces IL-17A(+) CD8(+) T cells that home to the epidermis, enhance innate barrier immunity and limit pathogen invasion. Commensal-specific T-cell responses result from the coordinated action of skin-resident dendritic cell subsets and are not associated with inflammation, revealing that tissue-resident cells are poised to sense and respond to alterations in microbial communities. This interaction may represent an evolutionary means by which the skin immune system uses fluctuating commensal signals to calibrate barrier immunity and provide heterologous protection against invasive pathogens. These findings reveal that the skin immune landscape is a highly dynamic environment that can be rapidly and specifically remodelled by encounters with defined commensals, findings that have profound implications for our understanding of tissue-specific immunity and pathologies.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Zoonotic viruses, such as HIV, Ebola virus, coronaviruses, influenza A viruses, hantaviruses, or henipaviruses, can result in profound pathology in humans. In contrast, populations of the reservoir hosts of zoonotic pathogens often appear to tolerate these infections with little evidence of disease. Why are viruses more dangerous in one species than another? Immunological studies investigating quantitative and qualitative differences in the host-virus equilibrium in animal reservoirs will be key to answering this question, informing new approaches for treating and preventing zoonotic diseases. Integrating an understanding of host immune responses with epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary insights into viral emergence will shed light on mechanisms that minimize fitness costs associated with viral infection, facilitate transmission to other hosts, and underlie the association of specific reservoir hosts with multiple emerging viruses. Reservoir host studies provide a rich opportunity for elucidating fundamental immunological processes and their underlying genetic basis, in the context of distinct physiological and metabolic constraints that contribute to host resistance and disease tolerance.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Transformation by the v-sis oncogene appears to require an interaction of its protein product, p28v-sis, with the receptor for the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). However, this interaction may not occur at the cell surface as predicted by the autocrine hypothesis because phenotypic transformation was not reversed by incubation of SSV-NRK cells with antisera to PDGF and because morphological transformation did not occur when nontransformed NRK cells were cultured continuously with p28v-sis. A mutant of the wild-type v-sis gene was constructed that encodes a v-sis protein targeted for retention within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. NRK cells expressing the mutant v-sis gene did not secrete any detectable v-sis protein but were as fully transformed as wild-type v-sis transfectants. The results support a mechanism of transformation by v-sis in which internal activation of the PDGF receptor occurs before expression of either p28v-sis or the PDGF receptor at the cell surface.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>To better determine the history of modern birds, we performed a genome-scale phylogenetic analysis of 48 species representing all orders of Neoaves using phylogenomic methods created to handle genome-scale data. We recovered a highly resolved tree that confirms previously controversial sister or close relationships. We identified the first divergence in Neoaves, two groups we named Passerea and Columbea, representing independent lineages of diverse and convergently evolved land and water bird species. Among Passerea, we infer the common ancestor of core landbirds to have been an apex predator and confirm independent gains of vocal learning. Among Columbea, we identify pigeons and flamingoes as belonging to sister clades. Even with whole genomes, some of the earliest branches in Neoaves proved challenging to resolve, which was best explained by massive protein-coding sequence convergence and high levels of incomplete lineage sorting that occurred during a rapid radiation after the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction event about 66 million years ago.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The leukocyte-common antigen (L-CA) is a family of large molecular weight glycoproteins uniquely expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells of hematopoietic origin. The glycoprotein consists of a heavily glycosylated exterior domain, a single membrane spanning region, and a large cytoplasmic domain that contains tyrosine phosphatase activity. To investigate the function of this family, we generated T cell clones that lacked L-CA (L-CA-). The expression of the alpha beta T cell receptor, CD3, CD4, IL-2 receptor (p55), LFA-1, Thy-1, and Pgp-1 (CD44) was normal. The L-CA- T cell clones failed to proliferate in response to antigen or cross-linked CD3; however, they could still proliferate in response to IL-2. An L-CA+ revertant was obtained and the ability to proliferate in response to antigen and cross-linked CD3 was restored. These data indicate that L-CA is required for T cells to enter into cell cycle in response to antigen.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) are well-recognized complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. There are several features that distinguish t-AML from de novo AML, including a higher incidence of TP53 mutations, abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7, complex cytogenetics and a reduced response to chemotherapy. However, it is not clear how prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy influences leukaemogenesis. In particular, the mechanism by which TP53 mutations are selectively enriched in t-AML/t-MDS is unknown. Here, by sequencing the genomes of 22 patients with t-AML, we show that the total number of somatic single-nucleotide variants and the percentage of chemotherapy-related transversions are similar in t-AML and de novo AML, indicating that previous chemotherapy does not induce genome-wide DNA damage. We identified four cases of t-AML/t-MDS in which the exact TP53 mutation found at diagnosis was also present at low frequencies (0.003-0.7%) in mobilized blood leukocytes or bone marrow 3-6 years before the development of t-AML/t-MDS, including two cases in which the relevant TP53 mutation was detected before any chemotherapy. Moreover, functional TP53 mutations were identified in small populations of peripheral blood cells of healthy chemotherapy-naive elderly individuals. Finally, in mouse bone marrow chimaeras containing both wild-type and Tp53(+/-) haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), the Tp53(+/-) HSPCs preferentially expanded after exposure to chemotherapy. These data suggest that cytotoxic therapy does not directly induce TP53 mutations. Rather, they support a model in which rare HSPCs carrying age-related TP53 mutations are resistant to chemotherapy and expand preferentially after treatment. The early acquisition of TP53 mutations in the founding HSPC clone probably contributes to the frequent cytogenetic abnormalities and poor responses to chemotherapy that are typical of patients with t-AML/t-MDS.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The capture of transient scenes at high imaging speed has been long sought by photographers, with early examples being the well known recording in 1878 of a horse in motion and the 1887 photograph of a supersonic bullet. However, not until the late twentieth century were breakthroughs achieved in demonstrating ultrahigh-speed imaging (more than 10(5) frames per second). In particular, the introduction of electronic imaging sensors based on the charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology revolutionized high-speed photography, enabling acquisition rates of up to 10(7) frames per second. Despite these sensors' widespread impact, further increasing frame rates using CCD or CMOS technology is fundamentally limited by their on-chip storage and electronic readout speed. Here we demonstrate a two-dimensional dynamic imaging technique, compressed ultrafast photography (CUP), which can capture non-repetitive time-evolving events at up to 10(11) frames per second. Compared with existing ultrafast imaging techniques, CUP has the prominent advantage of measuring an x-y-t (x, y, spatial coordinates; t, time) scene with a single camera snapshot, thereby allowing observation of transient events with temporal resolution as tens of picoseconds. Furthermore, akin to traditional photography, CUP is receive-only, and so does not need the specialized active illumination required by other single-shot ultrafast imagers. As a result, CUP can image a variety of luminescent--such as fluorescent or bioluminescent--objects. Using CUP, we visualize four fundamental physical phenomena with single laser shots only: laser pulse reflection and refraction, photon racing in two media, and faster-than-light propagation of non-information (that is, motion that appears faster than the speed of light but cannot convey information). Given CUP's capability, we expect it to find widespread applications in both fundamental and applied sciences, including biomedical research.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A recently developed cloning system based on the propagation of large DNA molecules as linear, artificial chromosomes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a potential method of cloning the entire human genome in segments of several hundred kilobase pairs. Most application of this system will require the ability to recover specific sequences from libraries of yeast artificial chromosome clones and to propagate these sequences in yeast without alterations. Two single-copy genes have now been cloned from a library of yeast artificial chromosome clones that was prepared from total human DNA. Multiple, independent isolates were obtained of the genes encoding factor IX and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2. The clones, which ranged in size from 60 to 650 kilobases, were stable on prolonged propagation in yeast and appear to contain faithful replicas of human DNA.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The capacity of human norovirus (NoV), which causes &gt;90% of global epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis, to infect a subset of people persistently may contribute to its spread. How such enteric viruses establish persistent infections is not well understood. We found that antibiotics prevented persistent murine norovirus (MNoV) infection, an effect that was reversed by replenishment of the bacterial microbiota. Antibiotics did not prevent tissue infection or affect systemic viral replication but acted specifically in the intestine. The receptor for the antiviral cytokine interferon-&#206;&#187;, Ifnlr1, as well as the transcription factors Stat1 and Irf3, were required for antibiotics to prevent viral persistence. Thus, the bacterial microbiome fosters enteric viral persistence in a manner counteracted by specific components of the innate immune system.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Norovirus gastroenteritis is a major public health burden worldwide. Although fecal shedding is important for transmission of enteric viruses, little is known about the immune factors that restrict persistent enteric infection. We report here that although the cytokines interferon-&#206;&#177; (IFN-&#206;&#177;) and IFN-&#206;&#178; prevented the systemic spread of murine norovirus (MNoV), only IFN-&#206;&#187; controlled persistent enteric infection. Infection-dependent induction of IFN-&#206;&#187; was governed by the MNoV capsid protein and correlated with diminished enteric persistence. Treatment of established infection with IFN-&#206;&#187; cured mice in a manner requiring nonhematopoietic cell expression of the IFN-&#206;&#187; receptor, Ifnlr1, and independent of adaptive immunity. These results suggest the therapeutic potential of IFN-&#206;&#187; for curing virus infections in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Two studies examined how U.S. presidents are forgotten. A total of 415 undergraduates in 1974, 1991, and 2009 recalled as many presidents as possible and attempted to place them in their correct ordinal positions. All showed roughly linear forgetting of the eight or nine presidents prior to the president holding office at the time, and recall of presidents without respect to ordinal position also showed a regular pattern of forgetting. Similar outcomes occurred with 497 adults (ages 18 to 69) tested in 2014. We fit forgetting functions to the data to predict when six relatively recent presidents will recede in memory to the level of most middle presidents (e.g., we predict that Truman will be forgotten to the same extent as McKinley by about 2040). These studies show that forgetting from collective memory can be studied empirically, as with forgetting in other forms of memory.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The immune system influences the fate of developing cancers by not only functioning as a tumour promoter that facilitates cellular transformation, promotes tumour growth and sculpts tumour cell immunogenicity, but also as an extrinsic tumour suppressor that either destroys developing tumours or restrains their expansion. Yet, clinically apparent cancers still arise in immunocompetent individuals in part as a consequence of cancer-induced immunosuppression. In many individuals, immunosuppression is mediated by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1), two immunomodulatory receptors expressed on T cells. Monoclonal-antibody-based therapies targeting CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 (checkpoint blockade) have yielded significant clinical benefits-including durable responses--to patients with different malignancies. However, little is known about the identity of the tumour antigens that function as the targets of T cells activated by checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and whether these antigens can be used to generate vaccines that are highly tumour-specific. Here we use genomics and bioinformatics approaches to identify tumour-specific mutant proteins as a major class of T-cell rejection antigens following anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 therapy of mice bearing progressively growing sarcomas, and we show that therapeutic synthetic long-peptide vaccines incorporating these mutant epitopes induce tumour rejection comparably to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Although mutant tumour-antigen-specific T cells are present in progressively growing tumours, they are reactivated following treatment with anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 and display some overlapping but mostly treatment-specific transcriptional profiles, rendering them capable of mediating tumour rejection. These results reveal that tumour-specific mutant antigens are not only important targets of checkpoint blockade therapy, but they can also be used to develop personalized cancer-specific vaccines and to probe the mechanistic underpinnings of different checkpoint blockade treatments.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (Cl-MPR) sorts newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes in the Golgi and endocytoses extracellular lysosomal enzymes. To determine the role of the 163 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of the Cl-MPR in these functions, receptor-deficient mouse L cells were transfected with normal bovine Cl-MPR cDNA or cDNAs mutated in the cytoplasmic domain. The normal Cl-MPR functioned in sorting and endocytosis. Mutant receptors with 40 and 89 residues deleted from the carboxyl terminus of the cytoplasmic tail functioned normally in endocytosis, but were partially impaired in sorting. Mutant receptors with larger deletions leaving only 7 and 20 residues of the cytoplasmic tail were defective in endocytosis and sorting. A mutant receptor containing alanine instead of tyrosine residues at positions 24 and 26 was defective in endocytosis, and partially impaired in sorting. Receptors deficient in endocytosis accumulated at the cell surface. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of the Cl-MPR contains different signals for rapid endocytosis and efficient lysosomal enzyme sorting.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We sequenced the MSY (male-specific region of the Y chromosome) of the C57BL/6J strain of the laboratory mouse Mus musculus. In contrast to theories that Y chromosomes are heterochromatic and gene poor, the mouse MSY is 99.9% euchromatic and contains about 700 protein-coding genes. Only 2% of the MSY derives from the ancestral autosomes that gave rise to the mammalian sex chromosomes. Instead, all but 45 of the MSY's genes belong to three acquired, massively amplified gene families that have no homologs on primate MSYs but do have acquired, amplified homologs on the mouse X chromosome. The complete mouse MSY sequence brings to light dramatic forces in sex chromosome evolution: lineage-specific convergent acquisition and amplification of X-Y gene families, possibly fueled by antagonism between acquired X-Y homologs. The mouse MSY sequence presents opportunities for experimental studies of a sex-specific chromosome in its entirety, in a genetically tractable model organism.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Broad and deep tumour genome sequencing has shed new light on tumour heterogeneity and provided important insights into the evolution of metastases arising from different clones. There is an additional layer of complexity, in that tumour evolution may be influenced by selective pressure provided by therapy, in a similar fashion to that occurring in infectious diseases. Here we studied tumour genomic evolution in a patient (index patient) with metastatic breast cancer bearing an activating PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha, PI(3)K&#206;&#177;) mutation. The patient was treated with the PI(3)K&#206;&#177; inhibitor BYL719, which achieved a lasting clinical response, but the patient eventually became resistant to this drug (emergence of lung metastases) and died shortly thereafter. A rapid autopsy was performed and material from a total of 14 metastatic sites was collected and sequenced. All metastatic lesions, when compared to the pre-treatment tumour, had a copy loss of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and those lesions that became refractory to BYL719 had additional and different PTEN genetic alterations, resulting in the loss of PTEN expression. To put these results in context, we examined six other patients also treated with BYL719. Acquired bi-allelic loss of PTEN was found in one of these patients, whereas in two others PIK3CA mutations present in the primary tumour were no longer detected at the time of progression. To characterize our findings functionally, we examined the effects of PTEN knockdown in several preclinical models (both in cell lines intrinsically sensitive to BYL719 and in PTEN-null xenografts derived from our index patient), which we found resulted in resistance to BYL719, whereas simultaneous PI(3)K p110&#206;&#178; blockade reverted this resistance phenotype. We conclude that parallel genetic evolution of separate metastatic sites with different PTEN genomic alterations leads to a convergent PTEN-null phenotype resistant to PI(3)K&#206;&#177; inhibition.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Controlling and reversing the effects of loss are major challenges in optical systems. For lasers, losses need to be overcome by a sufficient amount of gain to reach the lasing threshold. In this work, we show how to turn losses into gain by steering the parameters of a system to the vicinity of an exceptional point (EP), which occurs when the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates of a system coalesce. In our system of coupled microresonators, EPs are manifested as the loss-induced suppression and revival of lasing. Below a critical value, adding loss annihilates an existing Raman laser. Beyond this critical threshold, lasing recovers despite the increasing loss, in stark contrast to what would be expected from conventional laser theory. Our results exemplify the counterintuitive features of EPs and present an innovative method for reversing the effect of loss.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>To study how microbes establish themselves in a mammalian gut environment, we colonized germ-free mice with microbial communities from human, zebrafish, and termite guts, human skin and tongue, soil, and estuarine microbial mats. Bacteria from these foreign environments colonized and persisted in the mouse gut; their capacity to metabolize dietary and host carbohydrates and bile acids correlated with colonization success. Cohousing mice harboring these xenomicrobiota or a mouse cecal microbiota, along with germ-free "bystanders," revealed the success of particular bacterial taxa in invading guts with established communities and empty gut habitats. Unanticipated patterns of ecological succession were observed; for example, a soil-derived bacterium dominated even in the presence of bacteria from other gut communities (zebrafish and termite), and human-derived bacteria colonized germ-free bystander mice before mouse-derived organisms. This approach can be generalized to address a variety of mechanistic questions about succession, including succession in the context of microbiota-directed therapeutics.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Bone resorption depends on the formation, by osteoclasts, of an acidic extracellular compartment wherein matrix is degraded. The mechanism by which osteoclasts transport protons into that resorptive microenvironment was identified by means of adenosine triphosphate-dependent weak base accumulation in isolated osteoclast membrane vesicles, which exhibited substrate and inhibition properties characteristic of the vacuolar, electrogenic H+-transporting adenosine triphosphatase (H+-ATPase). Identify of the proton pump was confirmed by immunoblot of osteoclast membrane proteins probed with antibody to vacuolar H+-ATPase isolated from bovine kidney. The osteoclast's H+-ATPase was immunocytochemically localized to the cell-bone attachment site. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the H+-ATPase was present in the ruffled membrane, the resorptive organ of the cell.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Given the global burden of diarrhoeal diseases, it is important to understand how members of the gut microbiota affect the risk for, course of, and recovery from disease in children and adults. The acute, voluminous diarrhoea caused by Vibrio cholerae represents a dramatic example of enteropathogen invasion and gut microbial community disruption. Here we conduct a detailed time-series metagenomic study of faecal microbiota collected during the acute diarrhoeal and recovery phases of cholera in a cohort of Bangladeshi adults living in an area with a high burden of disease. We find that recovery is characterized by a pattern of accumulation of bacterial taxa that shows similarities to the pattern of assembly/maturation of the gut microbiota in healthy Bangladeshi children. To define the underlying mechanisms, we introduce into gnotobiotic mice an artificial community composed of human gut bacterial species that directly correlate with recovery from cholera in adults and are indicative of normal microbiota maturation in healthy Bangladeshi children. One of the species, Ruminococcus obeum, exhibits consistent increases in its relative abundance upon V. cholerae infection of the mice. Follow-up analyses, including mono- and co-colonization studies, establish that R. obeum restricts V. cholerae colonization, that R. obeum luxS (autoinducer-2 (AI-2) synthase) expression and AI-2 production increase significantly with V. cholerae invasion, and that R. obeum AI-2 causes quorum-sensing-mediated repression of several V. cholerae colonization factors. Co-colonization with V. cholerae mutants discloses that R. obeum AI-2 reduces Vibrio colonization/pathogenicity through a novel pathway that does not depend on the V. cholerae AI-2 sensor, LuxP. The approach described can be used to mine the gut microbiota of Bangladeshi or other populations for members that use autoinducers and/or other mechanisms to limit colonization with V. cholerae, or conceivably other enteropathogens.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Observations of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) provide valuable comparative data for understanding the significance of conspecific killing. Two kinds of hypothesis have been proposed. Lethal violence is sometimes concluded to be the result of adaptive strategies, such that killers ultimately gain fitness benefits by increasing their access to resources such as food or mates. Alternatively, it could be a non-adaptive result of human impacts, such as habitat change or food provisioning. To discriminate between these hypotheses we compiled information from 18 chimpanzee communities and 4 bonobo communities studied over five decades. Our data include 152 killings (n = 58 observed, 41 inferred, and 53 suspected killings) by chimpanzees in 15 communities and one suspected killing by bonobos. We found that males were the most frequent attackers (92% of participants) and victims (73%); most killings (66%) involved intercommunity attacks; and attackers greatly outnumbered their victims (median 8:1 ratio). Variation in killing rates was unrelated to measures of human impacts. Our results are compatible with previously proposed adaptive explanations for killing by chimpanzees, whereas the human impact hypothesis is not supported.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The role of cytoplasmic dynein in microtubule-based organelle transport was examined using a reconstituted assay developed from chick embryo fibroblasts. Factors present in a high-speed cytosol caused the movement of purified organelles on microtubules predominantly in the minus end direction. Inactivation of cytoplasmic dynein in the high-speed cytosol by vanadate-mediated UV photocleavage inhibited minus end-directed organelle motility by over 90%. Addition of purified cytoplasmic dynein to the inactive cytosol restored minus end-directed organelle motility, although purified cytoplasmic dynein by itself did not support organelle movement. We propose that cytoplasmic dynein is the motor for minus end-directed organelle movement, but that additional cytosolic factors are also required to produce organelle motility.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Curli are functional amyloid fibres that constitute the major protein component of the extracellular matrix in pellicle biofilms formed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (predominantly of the &#206;&#177; and &#206;&#179; classes). They provide a fitness advantage in pathogenic strains and induce a strong pro-inflammatory response during bacteraemia. Curli formation requires a dedicated protein secretion machinery comprising the outer membrane lipoprotein CsgG and two soluble accessory proteins, CsgE and CsgF. Here we report the X-ray structure of Escherichia coli CsgG in a non-lipidated, soluble form as well as in its native membrane-extracted conformation. CsgG forms an oligomeric transport complex composed of nine anticodon-binding-domain-like units that give rise to a 36-stranded &#206;&#178;-barrel that traverses the bilayer and is connected to a cage-like vestibule in the periplasm. The transmembrane and periplasmic domains are separated by a 0.9-nm channel constriction composed of three stacked concentric phenylalanine, asparagine and tyrosine rings that may guide the extended polypeptide substrate through the secretion pore. The specificity factor CsgE forms a nonameric adaptor that binds and closes off the periplasmic face of the secretion channel, creating a 24,000 &#195;&#133;(3) pre-constriction chamber. Our structural, functional and electrophysiological analyses imply that CsgG is an ungated, non-selective protein secretion channel that is expected to employ a diffusion-based, entropy-driven transport mechanism.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In complex biological systems, small molecules often mediate microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions. Using a systematic approach, we identified&#194;&#160;3,118 small-molecule biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in genomes of human-associated bacteria and studied their representation in 752 metagenomic samples from the NIH Human Microbiome Project. Remarkably, we discovered that BGCs for a class of&#194;&#160;antibiotics in clinical trials, thiopeptides, are widely distributed in genomes and metagenomes of the human microbiota. We purified and solved the structure of a thiopeptide antibiotic, lactocillin, from a&#194;&#160;prominent member of the vaginal microbiota. We demonstrate that lactocillin has potent antibacterial activity against a range of Gram-positive vaginal pathogens, and we show that lactocillin and other thiopeptide BGCs are expressed in&#194;&#160;vivo by analyzing human metatranscriptomic sequencing data. Our findings illustrate the widespread distribution of small-molecule-encoding BGCs in the human microbiome, and they demonstrate the bacterial production of drug-like molecules in humans.

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Gibbons are small arboreal apes that display an accelerated rate of evolutionary chromosomal rearrangement and occupy a key node in the primate phylogeny between Old World monkeys and great apes. Here we present the assembly and analysis of a northern white-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys) genome. We describe the propensity for a gibbon-specific retrotransposon (LAVA) to insert into chromosome segregation genes and alter transcription by providing a premature termination site, suggesting a possible molecular mechanism for the genome plasticity of the gibbon lineage. We further show that the gibbon genera (Nomascus, Hylobates, Hoolock and Symphalangus) experienced a near-instantaneous radiation &#226;&#136;&#188;5 million years ago, coincident with major geographical changes in southeast Asia that caused cycles of habitat compression and expansion. Finally, we identify signatures of positive selection in genes important for forelimb development (TBX5) and connective tissues (COL1A1) that may have been involved in the adaptation of gibbons to their arboreal habitat.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The bacteria that colonize humans and our built environments have the potential to influence our health. Microbial communities associated with seven families and their homes over 6 weeks were assessed, including three families that moved their home. Microbial communities differed substantially among homes, and the home microbiome was largely sourced from humans. The microbiota in each home were identifiable by family. Network analysis identified humans as the primary bacterial vector, and a Bayesian method significantly matched individuals to their dwellings. Draft genomes of potential human pathogens observed on a kitchen counter could be matched to the hands of occupants. After a house move, the microbial community in the new house rapidly converged on the microbial community of the occupants' former house, suggesting rapid colonization by the family's microbiota.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Genome function is dynamically regulated in part by chromatin, which consists of the histones, non-histone proteins and RNA molecules that package DNA. Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have contributed substantially to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of genome function in humans, and have revealed conservation of chromatin components and mechanisms. Nevertheless, the three organisms have markedly different genome sizes, chromosome architecture and gene organization. On human and fly chromosomes, for example, pericentric heterochromatin flanks single centromeres, whereas worm chromosomes have dispersed heterochromatin-like regions enriched in the distal chromosomal 'arms', and centromeres distributed along their lengths. To systematically investigate chromatin organization and associated gene regulation across species, we generated and analysed a large collection of genome-wide chromatin data sets from cell lines and developmental stages in worm, fly and human. Here we present over 800 new data sets from our ENCODE and modENCODE consortia, bringing the total to over 1,400. Comparison of combinatorial patterns of histone modifications, nuclear lamina-associated domains, organization of large-scale topological domains, chromatin environment at promoters and enhancers, nucleosome positioning, and DNA replication patterns reveals many conserved features of chromatin organization among the three organisms. We also find notable differences in the composition and locations of repressive chromatin. These data sets and analyses provide a rich resource for comparative and species-specific investigations of chromatin composition, organization and function.</p>

We present an electrochemical pathway in which ammonia is produced by electrolysis of air and steam in a molten hydroxide suspension of nano-Fe2O3. At 200&#194;&#176;C in an electrolyte with a molar ratio of 0.5 NaOH/0.5 KOH, ammonia is produced at 1.2 volts (V) under 2 milliamperes per centimeter squared (mA cm(-2)) of applied current at coulombic efficiency of 35% (35% of the applied current results in the six-electron conversion of N2 and water to ammonia, and excess H2 is cogenerated with the ammonia). At 250&#194;&#176;C and 25 bar of steam pressure, the electrolysis voltage necessary for 2 mA cm(-2) current density decreased to 1.0 V.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The ability to clone large fragments of DNA in yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC's) has created the possibility of obtaining global physical maps of complex genomes. For this application to be feasible, most sequences in complex genomes must be able to be cloned in YAC's, and most clones must be genetically stable and colinear with the genomic sequences from which they originated (that is, not liable to undergo rearrangement). These requirements have been met with a YAC library containing DNA fragments from Drosophila melanogaster ranging in size up to several hundred kilobase pairs. Preliminary characterization of the Drosophila YAC library was carried out by in situ hybridization of random clones and analysis of clones containing known sequences. The results suggest that most euchromatic sequences can be cloned. The library also contains clones in which the inserted DNA is derived from the centromeric heterochromatin. The locations of 58 clones collectively representing about 8 percent of the euchromatic genome are presented.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The mammalian intestine is colonized by beneficial commensal bacteria and is a site of infection by pathogens, including helminth parasites. Helminths induce potent immunomodulatory effects, but whether these effects are mediated by direct regulation of host immunity or indirectly through eliciting changes in the microbiota is unknown. We tested this in the context of virus-helminth coinfection. Helminth coinfection resulted in impaired antiviral immunity and was associated with changes in the microbiota and STAT6-dependent helminth-induced alternative activation of macrophages. Notably, helminth-induced impairment of antiviral immunity was evident in germ-free mice, but neutralization of Ym1, a chitinase-like molecule that is associated with alternatively activated macrophages, could partially restore antiviral immunity. These data indicate that helminth-induced immunomodulation occurs independently of changes in the microbiota but is dependent on Ym1.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A central feature of quantum mechanics is that a measurement result is intrinsically probabilistic. Consequently, continuously monitoring a quantum system will randomly perturb its natural unitary evolution. The ability to control a quantum system in the presence of these fluctuations is of increasing importance in quantum information processing and finds application in fields ranging from nuclear magnetic resonance to chemical synthesis. A detailed understanding of this stochastic evolution is essential for the development of optimized control methods. Here we reconstruct the individual quantum trajectories of a superconducting circuit that evolves under the competing influences of continuous weak measurement and Rabi drive. By tracking individual trajectories that evolve between any chosen initial and final states, we can deduce the most probable path through quantum state space. These pre- and post-selected quantum trajectories also reveal the optimal detector signal in the form of a smooth, time-continuous function that connects the desired boundary conditions. Our investigation reveals the rich interplay between measurement dynamics, typically associated with wavefunction collapse, and unitary evolution of the quantum state as described by the Schr&#195;&#182;dinger equation. These results and the underlying theory, based on a principle of least action, reveal the optimal route from initial to final states, and may inform new quantum control methods for state steering and information processing.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>To mediate its survival and virulence, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum exports hundreds of proteins into the host erythrocyte. To enter the host cell, exported proteins must cross the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) within which the parasite resides, but the mechanism remains unclear. A putative Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) has been suggested to be involved for at least one class of exported proteins; however, direct functional evidence for this has been elusive. Here we show that export across the PVM requires heat shock protein 101 (HSP101), a ClpB-like AAA+ ATPase component of PTEX. Using a chaperone auto-inhibition strategy, we achieved rapid, reversible ablation of HSP101 function, resulting in a nearly complete block in export with substrates accumulating in the vacuole in both asexual and sexual parasites. Surprisingly, this block extended to all classes of exported proteins, revealing HSP101-dependent translocation across the PVM as a convergent step in the multi-pathway export process. Under export-blocked conditions, association between HSP101 and other components of the PTEX complex was lost, indicating that the integrity of the complex is required for efficient protein export. Our results demonstrate an essential and universal role for HSP101 in protein export and provide strong evidence for PTEX function in protein translocation into the host cell.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins have been implicated in the transport of newly synthesized proteins along the secretory pathway of yeast and mammalian cells. Early vesicle fusion events that follow receptor-mediated endocytosis as measured by three in vitro assays were blocked by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and aluminum fluoride. The effect was specific for guanosine nucleotides and depended on the presence of cytosolic factors. Thus, GTP-binding proteins may also have a role in the transport of molecules along the endocytic pathway.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Mammals are coinfected by multiple pathogens that interact through unknown mechanisms. We found that helminth infection, characterized by the induction of the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) and the activation of the transcription factor Stat6, reactivated murine &#206;&#179;-herpesvirus infection in vivo. IL-4 promoted viral replication and blocked the antiviral effects of interferon-&#206;&#179; (IFN&#206;&#179;) by inducing Stat6 binding to the promoter for an important viral transcriptional transactivator. IL-4 also reactivated human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus from latency in cultured cells. Exogenous IL-4 plus blockade of IFN&#206;&#179; reactivated latent murine &#206;&#179;-herpesvirus infection in vivo, suggesting a "two-signal" model for viral reactivation. Thus, chronic herpesvirus infection, a component of the mammalian virome, is regulated by the counterpoised actions of multiple cytokines on viral promoters that have evolved to sense host immune status.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Mutant flies in which the gene coding for the Shaker potassium channel is deleted still have potassium currents similar to those coded by the Shaker gene. This suggests the presence of a family of Shaker-like genes in Drosophila. By using a Shaker complementary DNA probe and low-stringency hybridization, three additional family members have now been isolated, Shab, Shaw, and Shal. The Shaker family genes are not clustered in the genome. The deduced proteins of Shab, Shaw, and Shal have high homology to the Shaker protein; the sequence identity of the integral membrane portions is greater than 50 percent. These genes are organized similarly to Shaker in that only a single homology domain containing six presumed membrane-spanning segments common to all voltage-gated ion channels is coded by each messenger RNA. Thus, potassium channel diversity could result from an extended gene family, as well as from alternate splicing of the Shaker primary transcript.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A cellular sheath, the perineurium, forms a protective barrier around fascicles of nerve fibers throughout the peripheral nervous system. In a study to determine the cellular origin of perineurium, a culture system was used in which perineurium forms after purified populations of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and fibroblasts are recombined. Before recombination, the Schwann cells or the fibroblasts were labeled by infection with a defective recombinant retrovirus whose gene product, beta-galactosidase, is histochemically detectable in the progeny of infected cells. Perineurial cells were labeled when fibroblasts had been infected but not when Schwann cells had been infected. Thus, perineurium arises from fibroblasts in vitro and, by implication, in vivo as well.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Therapeutic food interventions have reduced mortality in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), but incomplete restoration of healthy growth remains a major problem. The relationships between the type of nutritional intervention, the gut microbiota, and therapeutic responses are unclear. In the current study, bacterial species whose proportional representation define a healthy gut microbiota as it assembles during the first two postnatal years were identified by applying a machine-learning-based approach to 16S ribosomal RNA data sets generated from monthly faecal samples obtained from birth onwards in a cohort of children living in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh, who exhibited consistently healthy growth. These age-discriminatory bacterial species were incorporated into a model that computes a 'relative microbiota maturity index' and 'microbiota-for-age Z-score' that compare postnatal assembly (defined here as maturation) of a child's faecal microbiota relative to healthy children of similar chronologic age. The model was applied to twins and triplets (to test for associations of these indices with genetic and environmental factors, including diarrhoea), children with SAM enrolled in a randomized trial of two food interventions, and children with moderate acute malnutrition. Our results indicate that SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity that is only partially ameliorated following two widely used nutritional interventions. Immaturity is also evident in less severe forms of malnutrition and correlates with anthropometric measurements. Microbiota maturity indices provide a microbial measure of human postnatal development, a way of classifying malnourished states, and a parameter for judging therapeutic efficacy. More prolonged interventions with existing or new therapeutic foods and/or addition of gut microbes may be needed to achieve enduring repair of gut microbiota immaturity in childhood malnutrition and improve clinical outcomes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Ancient and diverse antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have previously been identified from soil, including genes identical to those in human pathogens. Despite the apparent overlap between soil and clinical resistomes, factors influencing ARG composition in soil and their movement between genomes and habitats remain largely unknown. General metagenome functions often correlate with the underlying structure of bacterial communities. However, ARGs are proposed to be highly mobile, prompting speculation that resistomes may not correlate with phylogenetic signatures or ecological divisions. To investigate these relationships, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 18 antibiotics from 18 agricultural and grassland soils. The 2,895 ARGs we discovered were mostly new, and represent all major resistance mechanisms. We demonstrate that distinct soil types harbour distinct resistomes, and that the addition of nitrogen fertilizer strongly influenced soil ARG content. Resistome composition also correlated with microbial phylogenetic and taxonomic structure, both across and within soil types. Consistent with this strong correlation, mobility elements (genes responsible for horizontal gene transfer between bacteria such as transposases and integrases) syntenic with ARGs were rare in soil by comparison with sequenced pathogens, suggesting that ARGs may not transfer between soil bacteria as readily as is observed between human pathogens. Together, our results indicate that bacterial community composition is the primary determinant of soil ARG content, challenging previous hypotheses that horizontal gene transfer effectively decouples resistomes from phylogeny.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Groundwater use in California's San Joaquin Valley exceeds replenishment of the aquifer, leading to substantial diminution of this resource and rapid subsidence of the valley floor. The volume of groundwater lost over the past century and a half also represents a substantial reduction in mass and a large-scale unburdening of the lithosphere, with significant but unexplored potential impacts on crustal deformation and seismicity. Here we use vertical global positioning system measurements to show that a broad zone of rock uplift of up to 1-3 mm per year surrounds the southern San Joaquin Valley. The observed uplift matches well with predicted flexure from a simple elastic model of current rates of water-storage loss, most of which is caused by groundwater depletion. The height of the adjacent central Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada is strongly seasonal and peaks during the dry late summer and autumn, out of phase with uplift of the valley floor during wetter months. Our results suggest that long-term and late-summer flexural uplift of the Coast Ranges reduce the effective normal stress resolved on the San Andreas Fault. This process brings the fault closer to failure, thereby providing a viable mechanism for observed seasonality in microseismicity at Parkfield and potentially affecting long-term seismicity rates for fault systems adjacent to the valley. We also infer that the observed contemporary uplift of the southern Sierra Nevada previously attributed to tectonic or mantle-derived forces is partly a consequence of human-caused groundwater depletion.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Class I and class II MHC-restricted T lymphocytes recognize non-native forms of antigen. The presentation of antigen to these two classes of T lymphocytes can occur through distinct pathways. Several mechanisms, including differences in antigen processing in different intracellular compartments, have been proposed to account for these pathway differences. Here we describe a T-cell epitope located on the influenza virus haemaglutinin, which is recognized by both class I and class II MHC-restricted cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). When expressed de novo in target cells, from a synthetic minigene encoding only the epitope, this pre-processed antigenic site is recognized by class I but not class II MHC-restricted T lymphocytes, even though target cells treated with the exogenously introduced peptide can be recognized by both classes of T cells. Because endogenous expression of the pre-processed antigenic fragment results in differential presentation to class I and class II MHC-restricted CTL, differences between the two different pathways of presentation could lie not at the level of processing but at the level of targeting and/or interaction of processed antigen with MHC.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The human X and Y chromosomes evolved from an ordinary pair of autosomes, but millions of years ago genetic decay ravaged the Y chromosome, and only three per cent of its ancestral genes survived. We reconstructed the evolution of the Y chromosome across eight mammals to identify biases in gene content and the selective pressures that preserved the surviving ancestral genes. Our findings indicate that survival was nonrandom, and in two cases, convergent across placental and marsupial mammals. We conclude that the gene content of the Y chromosome became specialized through selection to maintain the ancestral dosage of homologous X-Y gene pairs that function as broadly expressed regulators of transcription, translation and protein stability. We propose that beyond its roles in testis determination and spermatogenesis, the Y chromosome is essential for male viability, and has unappreciated roles in Turner's syndrome and in phenotypic differences between the sexes in health and disease.</p>

Without rigorous standards we risk an acceleration of false-positive reports of causality, which would impede the translation of genomic research findings into the clinical diagnostic setting and hinder biological understanding of disease. Here we discuss the key challenges of assessing sequence variants in human disease, integrating both gene-level and variant-level support for causality. We propose guidelines for summarizing confidence in variant pathogenicity and highlight several areas that require further resource development.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In several types of locomoting cells, active rearward transport of particles on the cell surface has been observed and correlated with motility. No forward transport of particles has previously been reported, however. Here we report rapid forward transport of concanavalin A-coated gold particles on the dorsal surfaces of lamellipodia of fish epidermal keratocytes. These movements are active, not diffusive, and more rapid than either rearward particle transport or the rate of cell locomotion. We observed forward transport in migrating, but not in stationary cells, and could block the movement by treatment with cytochalasin D. These studies demonstrate for the first time that small numbers of glycoproteins can be actively transported on the surface of the cell to the front of the lamellipodium. We suggest that this mechanism transports proteins involved in cell locomotion, such as proteins necessary for adhesion, and could also produce an extensile force.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The mechanisms by which mucosal homeostasis is maintained are of central importance to inflammatory bowel disease. Critical to these processes is the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC), which regulates immune responses at the interface between the commensal microbiota and the host. CD1d presents self and microbial lipid antigens to natural killer T (NKT) cells, which are involved in the pathogenesis of colitis in animal models and human inflammatory bowel disease. As CD1d crosslinking on model IECs results in the production of the important regulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 (ref. 9), decreased epithelial CD1d expression--as observed in inflammatory bowel disease--may contribute substantially to intestinal inflammation. Here we show in mice that whereas bone-marrow-derived CD1d signals contribute to NKT-cell-mediated intestinal inflammation, engagement of epithelial CD1d elicits protective effects through the activation of STAT3 and STAT3-dependent transcription of IL-10, heat shock protein 110 (HSP110; also known as HSP105), and CD1d itself. All of these epithelial elements are critically involved in controlling CD1d-mediated intestinal inflammation. This is demonstrated by severe NKT-cell-mediated colitis upon IEC-specific deletion of IL-10, CD1d, and its critical regulator microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), as well as deletion of HSP110 in the radioresistant compartment. Our studies thus uncover a novel pathway of IEC-dependent regulation of mucosal homeostasis and highlight a critical role of IL-10 in the intestinal epithelium, with broad implications for diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

The mammalian virome is constituted of viruses that infect host cells, virus-derived elements in our chromosomes, and viruses that infect the broad array of other types of organisms that inhabit us. Virome interactions with the host cannot be encompassed by a monotheistic view of viruses as pathogens. Instead, the genetic and transcriptional identity of mammals is defined in part by our coevolved virome, a concept with profound implications for understanding health and disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Splenic red pulp macrophages (RPM) degrade senescent erythrocytes and recycle heme-associated iron. The transcription factor SPI-C is selectively expressed by RPM and is required for their development, but the physiologic stimulus inducing Spic is unknown. Here, we report that Spic also regulated the development of F4/80(+)VCAM1(+) bone marrow macrophages (BMM) and that Spic expression in BMM and RPM development was induced by heme, a metabolite of erythrocyte degradation. Pathologic hemolysis induced loss of RPM and BMM due to excess heme but induced Spic in monocytes to generate new RPM and BMM. Spic expression in monocytes was constitutively inhibited by the transcriptional repressor BACH1. Heme induced proteasome-dependent BACH1 degradation and rapid Spic derepression. Furthermore, cysteine-proline dipeptide motifs in BACH1 that mediate heme-dependent degradation were necessary for Spic induction by heme. These findings are the first example of metabolite-driven differentiation of a tissue-resident macrophage subset and provide new insights into iron homeostasis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The glycoprotein hormones lutropin (LH) and follitropin (FSH), which have common alpha-subunits but hormone-specific beta-subunits, are both synthesized in the gonadotroph. However, they bear Asn-linked oligosaccharides that differ in structure. Those on LH terminate with the sequence SO4-4GalNAc beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2Man alpha, whereas those on FSH terminate with the sequence sialic acid alpha-Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----2Man alpha. A GalNAc-transferase was identified in bovine pituitary membranes that recognizes features of the alpha-subunit peptide and adds GalNAc to its oligosaccharides with an apparent Michaelis constant of 25 micromolar. The different patterns of glycosylation for LH and FSH indicate that access to the protein recognition marker on the alpha-subunit is modulated by the associated beta-subunit. The tightly regulated synthesis of sulfated and sialylated oligosaccharides on the pituitary glycoprotein hormones suggests these oligosaccharides have an important biological role.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Biosynthesis of ubiquinones requires the intramembrane UbiA enzyme, an archetypal member of a superfamily of prenyltransferases that generates lipophilic aromatic compounds. Mutations in eukaryotic superfamily members have been linked to cardiovascular degeneration and Parkinson's disease. To understand how quinones are produced within membranes, we report the crystal structures of an archaeal UbiA in its apo and substrate-bound states at 3.3 and 3.6 angstrom resolution, respectively. The structures reveal nine transmembrane helices and an extramembrane cap domain that surround a large central cavity containing the active site. To facilitate the catalysis inside membranes, UbiA has an unusual active site that opens laterally to the lipid bilayer. Our studies illuminate general mechanisms for substrate recognition and catalysis in the UbiA superfamily and rationalize disease-related mutations in humans.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Members of the nuclear factor-&#206;&#186;B (NF-&#206;&#186;B) family of transcriptional regulators are central mediators of the cellular inflammatory response. Although constitutive NF-&#206;&#186;B signalling is present in most human tumours, mutations in pathway members are rare, complicating efforts to understand and block aberrant NF-&#206;&#186;B activity in cancer. Here we show that more than two-thirds of supratentorial ependymomas contain oncogenic fusions between RELA, the principal effector of canonical NF-&#206;&#186;B signalling, and an uncharacterized gene, C11orf95. In each case, C11orf95-RELA fusions resulted from chromothripsis involving chromosome 11q13.1. C11orf95-RELA fusion proteins translocated spontaneously to the nucleus to activate NF-&#206;&#186;B target genes, and rapidly transformed neural stem cells--the cell of origin of ependymoma--to form these tumours in mice. Our data identify a highly recurrent genetic alteration of RELA in human cancer, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion protein as a potential therapeutic target in supratentorial ependymoma.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The transcription factors c-Myc and N-Myc--encoded by Myc and Mycn, respectively--regulate cellular growth and are required for embryonic development. A third paralogue, Mycl1, is dispensable for normal embryonic development but its biological function has remained unclear. To examine the in vivo function of Mycl1 in mice, we generated an inactivating Mycl1(gfp) allele that also reports Mycl1 expression. We find that Mycl1 is selectively expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) of the immune system and controlled by IRF8, and that during DC development, Mycl1 expression is initiated in the common DC progenitor concurrent with reduction in c-Myc expression. Mature DCs lack expression of c-Myc and N-Myc but maintain L-Myc expression even in the presence of inflammatory signals such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. All DC subsets develop in Mycl1-deficient mice, but some subsets such as migratory CD103(+) conventional DCs in the lung and liver are greatly reduced at steady state. Importantly, loss of L-Myc by DCs causes a significant decrease in in vivo T-cell priming during infection by Listeria monocytogenes and vesicular stomatitis virus. The replacement of c-Myc by L-Myc in immature DCs may provide for Myc transcriptional activity in the setting of inflammation that is required for optimal T-cell priming.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although interferon (IFN) signaling induces genes that limit viral infection, many pathogenic viruses overcome this host response. As an example, 2'-O methylation of the 5' cap of viral RNA subverts mammalian antiviral responses by evading restriction of Ifit1, an IFN-stimulated gene that regulates protein synthesis. However, alphaviruses replicate efficiently in cells expressing Ifit1 even though their genomic RNA has a 5' cap lacking 2'-O methylation. We show that pathogenic alphaviruses use secondary structural motifs within the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of their RNA to alter Ifit1 binding and function. Mutations within the 5'-UTR affecting RNA structural elements enabled restriction by or antagonism of Ifit1 in vitro and in vivo. These results identify an evasion mechanism by which viruses use RNA structural motifs to avoid immune restriction.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Opportunity has investigated in detail rocks on the rim of the Noachian age Endeavour crater, where orbital spectral reflectance signatures indicate the presence of Fe(+3)-rich smectites. The signatures are associated with fine-grained, layered rocks containing spherules of diagenetic or impact origin. The layered rocks are overlain by breccias, and both units are cut by calcium sulfate veins precipitated from fluids that circulated after the Endeavour impact. Compositional data for fractures in the layered rocks suggest formation of Al-rich smectites by aqueous leaching. Evidence is thus preserved for water-rock interactions before and after the impact, with aqueous environments of slightly acidic to circum-neutral pH that would have been more favorable for prebiotic chemistry and microorganisms than those recorded by younger sulfate-rich rocks at Meridiani Planum.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Traumatic events generate some of the most enduring forms of memories. Despite the elevated&#194;&#160;lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders, effective strategies to attenuate long-term traumatic&#194;&#160;memories are scarce. The most efficacious treatments to diminish recent (i.e., day-old) traumata capitalize on memory updating mechanisms during reconsolidation that are initiated upon memory recall. Here, we show that, in mice, successful reconsolidation-updating paradigms for recent memories fail to attenuate remote (i.e., month-old) ones. We find that, whereas recent memory recall induces a&#194;&#160;limited period of hippocampal neuroplasticity mediated, in part, by S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 and&#194;&#160;histone acetylation, such plasticity is absent for remote memories. However, by using an HDAC2-targeting inhibitor (HDACi) during reconsolidation, even remote memories can be persistently attenuated. This intervention epigenetically primes the expression of neuroplasticity-related genes, which is accompanied by higher metabolic, synaptic, and structural plasticity. Thus, applying HDACis during memory reconsolidation might constitute a treatment option for remote traumata.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The emergence of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) from jawless vertebrates was accompanied by major morphological and physiological innovations, such as hinged jaws, paired fins and immunoglobulin-based adaptive immunity. Gnathostomes subsequently diverged into two groups, the cartilaginous fishes and the bony vertebrates. Here we report the whole-genome analysis of a cartilaginous fish, the elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii). We find that the C.&#226;&#128;&#137;milii genome is the slowest evolving of all known vertebrates, including the 'living fossil' coelacanth, and features extensive synteny conservation with tetrapod genomes, making it a good model for comparative analyses of gnathostome genomes. Our functional studies suggest that the lack of genes encoding secreted calcium-binding phosphoproteins in cartilaginous fishes explains the absence of bone in their endoskeleton. Furthermore, the adaptive immune system of cartilaginous fishes is unusual: it lacks the canonical CD4 co-receptor and most transcription factors, cytokines and cytokine receptors related to the CD4 lineage, despite the presence of polymorphic major histocompatibility complex class&#226;&#128;&#137;II molecules. It thus presents a new model for understanding the origin of adaptive immunity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>There are no clinically relevant treatments available that improve function in the growing population of very preterm infants (less than 32 weeks' gestation) with neonatal brain injury. Diffuse white matter injury (DWMI) is a common finding in these children and results in chronic neurodevelopmental impairments. As shown recently, failure in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell maturation contributes to DWMI. We demonstrated previously that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has an important role in oligodendrocyte development. Here we examine whether enhanced EGFR signalling stimulates the endogenous response of EGFR-expressing progenitor cells during a critical period after brain injury, and promotes cellular and behavioural recovery in the developing brain. Using an established mouse model of very preterm brain injury, we demonstrate that selective overexpression of human EGFR in oligodendrocyte lineage cells or the administration of intranasal heparin-binding EGF immediately after injury decreases oligodendroglia death, enhances generation of new oligodendrocytes from progenitor cells and promotes functional recovery. Furthermore, these interventions diminish ultrastructural abnormalities and alleviate behavioural deficits on white-matter-specific paradigms. Inhibition of EGFR signalling with a molecularly targeted agent used for cancer therapy demonstrates that EGFR activation is an important contributor to oligodendrocyte regeneration and functional recovery after DWMI. Thus, our study provides direct evidence that targeting EGFR in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells at a specific time after injury is clinically feasible and potentially applicable to the treatment of premature children with white matter injury.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Early flowering plants are thought to have been woody species restricted to warm habitats. This lineage has since radiated into almost every climate, with manifold growth forms. As angiosperms spread and climate changed, they evolved mechanisms to cope with episodic freezing. To explore the evolution of traits underpinning the ability to persist in freezing conditions, we assembled a large species-level database of growth habit (woody or herbaceous; 49,064 species), as well as leaf phenology (evergreen or deciduous), diameter of hydraulic conduits (that is, xylem vessels and tracheids) and climate occupancies (exposure to freezing). To model the evolution of species' traits and climate occupancies, we combined these data with an unparalleled dated molecular phylogeny (32,223 species) for land plants. Here we show that woody clades successfully moved into freezing-prone environments by either possessing transport networks of small safe conduits and/or shutting down hydraulic function by dropping leaves during freezing. Herbaceous species largely avoided freezing periods by senescing cheaply constructed aboveground tissue. Growth habit has long been considered labile, but we find that growth habit was less labile than climate occupancy. Additionally, freezing environments were largely filled by lineages that had already become herbs or, when remaining woody, already had small conduits (that is, the trait evolved before the climate occupancy). By contrast, most deciduous woody lineages had an evolutionary shift to seasonally shedding their leaves only after exposure to freezing (that is, the climate occupancy evolved before the trait). For angiosperms to inhabit novel cold environments they had to gain new structural and functional trait solutions; our results suggest that many of these solutions were probably acquired before their foray into the cold.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A major challenge for the development of a highly effective AIDS vaccine is the identification of mechanisms of protective immunity. To address this question, we used a nonhuman primate challenge model with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We show that antibodies to the SIV envelope are necessary and sufficient to prevent infection. Moreover, sequencing of viruses from breakthrough infections revealed selective pressure against neutralization-sensitive viruses; we identified a two-amino-acid signature that alters antigenicity and confers neutralization resistance. A similar signature confers resistance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies against variable regions 1 and 2 (V1V2), suggesting that SIV and HIV share a fundamental mechanism of immune escape from vaccine-elicited or naturally elicited antibodies. These analyses provide insight into the limited efficacy seen in HIV vaccine trials.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In photosynthetic organisms, photons are captured by light-harvesting antenna complexes, and energy is transferred to reaction centers where photochemical reactions take place. We describe here the isolation and characterization of a fully functional megacomplex composed of a phycobilisome antenna complex and photosystems I and II from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. A combination of in vivo protein cross-linking, mass spectrometry, and time-resolved spectroscopy indicates that the megacomplex is organized to facilitate energy transfer but not intercomplex electron transfer, which requires diffusible intermediates and the cytochrome b6f complex. The organization provides a basis for understanding how phycobilisomes transfer excitation energy to reaction centers and how the energy balance of two photosystems is achieved, allowing the organism to adapt to varying ecophysiological conditions.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The type I interferon (IFN) response protects cells from viral infection by inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), some of which encode direct antiviral effectors. Recent screening studies have begun to catalogue ISGs with antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses. However, antiviral ISG specificity across multiple distinct classes of viruses remains largely unexplored. Here we used an ectopic expression assay to screen a library of more than 350 human ISGs for effects on 14 viruses representing 7 families and 11 genera. We show that 47 genes inhibit one or more viruses, and 25 genes enhance virus infectivity. Comparative analysis reveals that the screened ISGs target positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses more effectively than negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Gene clustering highlights the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS, also known as MB21D1) as a gene whose expression also broadly inhibits several RNA viruses. In vitro, lentiviral delivery of enzymatically active cGAS triggers a STING-dependent, IRF3-mediated antiviral program that functions independently of canonical IFN/STAT1 signalling. In vivo, genetic ablation of murine cGAS reveals its requirement in the antiviral response to two DNA viruses, and an unappreciated contribution to the innate control of an RNA virus. These studies uncover new paradigms for the preferential specificity of IFN-mediated antiviral pathways spanning several virus families.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Reactivation of a silent transcriptional program is a critical step in successful axon regeneration following injury. Yet how such a program is unlocked after injury remains largely unexplored. We found that axon injury in peripheral sensory neurons elicits a back-propagating calcium wave that invades the soma and causes nuclear export of HDAC5 in a PKC&#206;&#188;-dependent manner. Injury-induced HDAC5 nuclear export enhances histone acetylation to activate a proregenerative gene-expression program. HDAC5 nuclear export is required for axon regeneration, as expression of a nuclear-trapped HDAC5 mutant prevents axon regeneration, whereas enhancing HDAC5 nuclear export promotes axon regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Components of this HDAC5 pathway failed to be activated in a model of central nervous system injury. These studies reveal a signaling mechanism from the axon injury site to the soma that controls neuronal growth competence and suggest a role for HDAC5 as a transcriptional switch controlling axon regeneration.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has used the latest sequencing and analysis methods to identify somatic variants across thousands of tumours. Here we present data and analytical results for point mutations and small insertions/deletions from 3,281 tumours across 12 tumour types as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort. We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types and contexts across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin, environmental/carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated data sets, we identified 127 significantly mutated genes from well-known (for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, Wnt/&#206;&#178;-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, and cell cycle control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing, metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer. The average number of mutations in these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most tumours have two to six, indicating that the number of driver mutations required during oncogenesis is relatively small. Mutations in transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers are often mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies genes having a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations with respect to clonal/subclonal architecture delineate their temporal orders during tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results lay the groundwork for developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treatment.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Lymphocytes face major metabolic challenges upon activation. They must meet the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of increased cell proliferation and also adapt to changing environmental conditions, in which nutrients and oxygen may be limiting. An emerging theme in immunology is that metabolic reprogramming and lymphocyte activation are intricately linked. However, why T cells adopt specific metabolic programs and the impact that these programs have on T cell function and, ultimately, immunological outcome remain unclear. Research on tumor cell metabolism has provided valuable insight into metabolic pathways important for cell proliferation and the influence of metabolites themselves on signal transduction and epigenetic programming. In this Review, we highlight emerging concepts regarding metabolic reprogramming in proliferating cells and discuss their potential impact on T cell fate and function.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Genomics is a relatively new scientific discipline, having DNA sequencing as its core technology. As technology has improved the cost and scale of genome characterization over sequencing's 40-year history, the scope of inquiry has commensurately broadened. Massively parallel sequencing has proven revolutionary, shifting the paradigm of genomics to address biological questions at a genome-wide scale. Sequencing now empowers clinical diagnostics and other aspects of medical care, including disease risk, therapeutic identification, and prenatal testing. This Review explores the current state of genomics in the massively parallel sequencing era.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The role of specific gut microbes in shaping body composition remains unclear. We transplanted fecal microbiota from adult female twin pairs discordant for obesity into germ-free mice fed low-fat mouse chow, as well as diets representing different levels of saturated fat and fruit and vegetable consumption typical of the U.S. diet. Increased total body and fat mass, as well as obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes, were transmissible with uncultured fecal communities and with their corresponding fecal bacterial culture collections. Cohousing mice harboring an obese twin's microbiota (Ob) with mice containing the lean co-twin's microbiota (Ln) prevented the development of increased body mass and obesity-associated metabolic phenotypes in Ob cage mates. Rescue correlated with invasion of specific members of Bacteroidetes from the Ln microbiota into Ob microbiota and was diet-dependent.

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although RAF kinases are critical for controlling cell&#194;&#160;growth, their mechanism of activation is incompletely understood. Recently, dimerization was shown to be important for activation. Here we show that the dimer is functionally asymmetric with one kinase functioning as an activator to stimulate activity of the partner, receiver kinase. The activator kinase did not require kinase activity but did require N-terminal phosphorylation that functioned allosterically to induce cis-autophosphorylation of the receiver kinase. Based on modeling of the hydrophobic spine assembly, we also engineered a constitutively active mutant that was independent of Ras, dimerization, and activation-loop phosphorylation. As N-terminal phosphorylation of BRAF is constitutive, BRAF initially functions to activate CRAF. N-terminal phosphorylation of CRAF was dependent on MEK, suggesting a feedback mechanism and explaining a key difference between BRAF and CRAF. Our work illuminates distinct steps in RAF activation that function to assemble the active conformation of the RAF kinase.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Visual presentation of words activates extrastriate regions of the occipital lobes of the brain. When analyzed by positron emission tomography (PET), certain areas in the left, medial extrastriate visual cortex were activated by visually presented pseudowords that obey English spelling rules, as well as by actual words. These areas were not activated by nonsense strings of letters or letter-like forms. Thus visual word form computations are based on learned distinctions between words and nonwords. In addition, during passive presentation of words, but not pseudowords, activation occurred in a left frontal area that is related to semantic processing. These findings support distinctions made in cognitive psychology and computational modeling between high-level visual and semantic computations on single words and describe the anatomy that may underlie these distinctions.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Phagocytosis and degradation of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is fundamental to vision. Autophagy is also responsible for bulk degradation of cellular components, but its role in POS degradation is not well understood. We report that the morning burst of RPE phagocytosis coincided with the enzymatic conversion of autophagy protein LC3 to its lipidated form. LC3 associated with single-membrane phagosomes containing engulfed POS in an Atg5-dependent manner that required Beclin1, but not the autophagy preinitiation complex. The importance of this process was verified in mice with Atg5-deficient RPE cells that showed evidence of disrupted lysosomal processing. These mice also exhibited decreased photoreceptor responses to light stimuli and decreased chromophore levels that were restored with exogenous retinoid supplementation. These results establish that the interplay of phagocytosis and autophagy within the RPE is required for both POS degradation and the maintenance of retinoid levels to support vision.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A low-error 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing method, in combination with whole-genome sequencing of &gt;500 cultured isolates, was used to characterize bacterial strain composition in the fecal microbiota of 37 U.S. adults sampled for up to 5 years. Microbiota stability followed a power-law function, which when extrapolated suggests that most strains in an individual are residents for decades. Shared strains were recovered from family members but not from unrelated individuals. Sampling of individuals who consumed a monotonous liquid diet for up to 32 weeks indicated that changes in strain composition were better predicted by changes in weight than by differences in sampling interval. This combination of stability and responsiveness to physiologic change confirms the potential of the gut microbiota as a diagnostic tool and therapeutic target.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A "switch" from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of T cell activation and is thought to be required to meet the metabolic demands of proliferation. However, why proliferating cells adopt this less efficient metabolism, especially in an oxygen-replete environment, remains incompletely understood. We show here that aerobic glycolysis is specifically required for effector function in T cells but that this pathway is not necessary for proliferation or survival. When activated T cells are provided with costimulation and growth factors but are blocked from engaging glycolysis, their ability to produce IFN-&#206;&#179; is markedly compromised. This defect is translational and is regulated by the binding of the glycolysis enzyme GAPDH to AU-rich elements within the 3' UTR of IFN-&#206;&#179; mRNA. GAPDH, by engaging/disengaging glycolysis and through fluctuations in its expression, controls effector cytokine production. Thus, aerobic glycolysis is a metabolically regulated signaling mechanism needed to control cellular function.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Senescent and damaged mitochondria undergo selective mitophagic elimination through mechanisms requiring two Parkinson's disease factors, the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase protein 1; PTEN is phosphatase and tensin homolog) and the cytosolic ubiquitin ligase Parkin. The nature of the PINK-Parkin interaction and the identity of key factors directing Parkin to damaged mitochondria are unknown. We show that the mitochondrial outer membrane guanosine triphosphatase mitofusin (Mfn) 2 mediates Parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria. Parkin bound to Mfn2 in a PINK1-dependent manner; PINK1 phosphorylated Mfn2 and promoted its Parkin-mediated ubiqitination. Ablation of Mfn2 in mouse cardiac myocytes prevented depolarization-induced translocation of Parkin to the mitochondria and suppressed mitophagy. Accumulation of morphologically and functionally abnormal mitochondria induced respiratory dysfunction in Mfn2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes and in Parkin-deficient Drosophila heart tubes, causing dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, Mfn2 functions as a mitochondrial receptor for Parkin and is required for quality control of cardiac mitochondria.</p>

Flunarizine-treated rats lost 71 percent fewer neurons than the untreated control rats at the end of 1 week. In cell culture, flunarizine at 30 to 40 microM also prevented neuronal death in nerve growth factor-dependent embryonic sensory and sympathetic neurons after the abrupt withdrawal of neurotrophic support. The drug may cause this effect by acting at an intracellular site, one distinct from its blockade of voltage-dependent calcium channels.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Using historic data sets, we quantified the degree to which global change over 120 years disrupted plant-pollinator interactions in a temperate forest understory community in Illinois, USA. We found degradation of interaction network structure and function and extirpation of 50% of bee species. Network changes can be attributed to shifts in forb and bee phenologies resulting in temporal mismatches, nonrandom species extinctions, and loss of spatial co-occurrences between extant species in modified landscapes. Quantity and quality of pollination services have declined through time. The historic network showed flexibility in response to disturbance; however, our data suggest that networks will be less resilient to future changes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) primarily reside in the bone marrow where signals generated by stromal cells regulate their self-renewal, proliferation and trafficking. Endosteal osteoblasts and perivascular stromal cells including endothelial cells, CXCL12-abundant reticular cells, leptin-receptor-positive stromal cells, and nestin-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive mesenchymal progenitors have all been implicated in HSC maintenance. However, it is unclear whether specific haematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) subsets reside in distinct niches defined by the surrounding stromal cells and the regulatory molecules they produce. CXCL12 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12) regulates both HSCs and lymphoid progenitors and is expressed by all of these stromal cell populations. Here we selectively deleted Cxcl12 from candidate niche stromal cell populations and characterized the effect on HPCs. Deletion of Cxcl12 from mineralizing osteoblasts has no effect on HSCs or lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from osterix-expressing stromal cells, which include CXCL12-abundant reticular cells and osteoblasts, results in constitutive HPC mobilization and a loss of B-lymphoid progenitors, but HSC function is normal. Cxcl12 deletion from endothelial cells results in a modest loss of long-term repopulating activity. Strikingly, deletion of Cxcl12 from nestin-negative mesenchymal progenitors using Prx1-cre (Prx1 also known as Prrx1) is associated with a marked loss of HSCs, long-term repopulating activity, HSC quiescence and common lymphoid progenitors. These data suggest that osterix-expressing stromal cells comprise a distinct niche that supports B-lymphoid progenitors and retains HPCs in the bone marrow, and that expression of CXCL12 from stromal cells in the perivascular region, including endothelial cells and mesenchymal progenitors, supports HSCs.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Kwashiorkor, an enigmatic form of severe acute malnutrition, is the consequence of inadequate nutrient intake plus additional environmental insults. To investigate the role of the gut microbiome, we studied 317 Malawian twin pairs during the first 3 years of life. During this time, half of the twin pairs remained well nourished, whereas 43% became discordant, and 7% manifested concordance for acute malnutrition. Both children in twin pairs discordant for kwashiorkor were treated with a peanut-based, ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). Time-series metagenomic studies revealed that RUTF produced a transient maturation of metabolic functions in kwashiorkor gut microbiomes that regressed when administration of RUTF was stopped. Previously frozen fecal communities from several discordant pairs were each transplanted into gnotobiotic mice. The combination of Malawian diet and kwashiorkor microbiome produced marked weight loss in recipient mice, accompanied by perturbations in amino acid, carbohydrate, and intermediary metabolism that were only transiently ameliorated with RUTF. These findings implicate the gut microbiome as a causal factor in kwashiorkor.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The Drosophila Shaker gene on the X chromosome has three sister genes, Shal, Shab, and Shaw, which map to the second and third chromosomes. This extended gene family encodes voltage-gated potassium channels with widely varying kinetics (rate of macroscopic current activation and inactivation) and voltage sensitivity of steady-state inactivation. The differences in the currents of the various gene products are greater than the differences produced by alternative splicing of the Shaker gene. In Drosophila, the transient (A current) subtype of the potassium channel (Shaker and Shal) and the delayed-rectifier subtype (Shab and Shaw) are encoded by homologous genes, and there is more than one gene for each subtype of channel. Homologs of Shaker, Shal, Shab, and Shaw are present in mammals; each Drosophila potassium-channel gene may be represented as a multigene subfamily in mammals.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although invasive plant species often reduce diversity, they rarely cause plant extinctions. We surveyed paired invaded and uninvaded plant communities from three biomes. We reconcile the discrepancy in diversity loss from invaders by showing that invaded communities have lower local richness but steeper species accumulation with area than that of uninvaded communities, leading to proportionately fewer species loss at broader spatial scales. We show that invaders drive scale-dependent biodiversity loss through strong neutral sampling effects on the number of individuals in a community. We also show that nonneutral species extirpations are due to a proportionately larger effect of invaders on common species, suggesting that rare species are buffered against extinction. Our study provides a synthetic perspective on the threat of invasions to biodiversity loss across spatial scales.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Formation of the nervous system requires that neuronal growth cones follow specific paths and then stop at recognition signals, sensed at the growth cone's leading edge. We used antibody-coated gold particles viewed by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy to observe the distribution and movement of two cell surface molecules, N-CAM and the 2A1 antigen, on growth cones of cultured cortical neurons. Gold particles are occasionally transported forward at 1-2 microns/s to the leading edge where they are trapped but continue to move. Concentration at the edge persists after cytochalasin D treatment or ATP depletion, but active movements to and along edges cease. We also observed a novel outward movement of small cytoplasmic aggregates at 1.8 microns/s in filopodia. We suggest that active forward transport and trapping involve reversible attachment of antigens to and transport along cytoskeletal elements localized to edges of growth cones.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Volatile elements have a fundamental role in the evolution of planets. But how budgets of volatiles were set in planets, and the nature and extent of volatile-depletion of planetary bodies during the earliest stages of Solar System formation remain poorly understood. The Moon is considered to be volatile-depleted and so it has been predicted that volatile loss should have fractionated stable isotopes of moderately volatile elements. One such element, zinc, exhibits strong isotopic fractionation during volatilization in planetary rocks, but is hardly fractionated during terrestrial igneous processes, making it a powerful tracer of the volatile histories of planets. Here we present high-precision zinc isotopic and abundance data which show that lunar magmatic rocks are enriched in the heavy isotopes of zinc and have lower zinc concentrations than terrestrial or Martian igneous rocks. Conversely, Earth and Mars have broadly chondritic zinc isotopic compositions. We show that these variations represent large-scale evaporation of zinc, most probably in the aftermath of the Moon-forming event, rather than small-scale evaporation processes during volcanism. Our results therefore represent evidence for volatile depletion of the Moon through evaporation, and are consistent with a giant impact origin for the Earth and Moon.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Pathogenic simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection is associated with enteropathy, which likely contributes to AIDS progression. To identify candidate etiologies for AIDS enteropathy, we used next-generation sequencing to define the enteric virome during SIV infection in nonhuman primates. Pathogenic, but not nonpathogenic, SIV infection was associated with significant expansion of the enteric virome. We identified at least 32 previously undescribed enteric viruses during pathogenic SIV infection and confirmed their presence by using viral culture and PCR testing. We detected unsuspected mucosal adenovirus infection associated with enteritis as well as parvovirus viremia in animals with advanced AIDS, indicating the pathogenic potential of SIV-associated expansion of the enteric virome. No association between pathogenic SIV infection and the family-level taxonomy of enteric bacteria was detected. Thus, enteric viral infections may contribute to AIDS enteropathy and disease progression. These findings underline the importance of metagenomic analysis of the virome for understanding AIDS pathogenesis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The earliest hominid from South Africa, Australopithecus africanus, is known from only six specimens in which accurate assessment of endocranial capacity and cranial venous outflow pattern can be obtained. This places a severe limit on a number of hypotheses concerning early hominid evolution, particularly those involving brain-body size relationships and adaptations of the circulatory system to evolving upright posture. Advances in high-resolution two- and three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) now allow the inclusion of another important specimen to this list, MLD 37/38 from Makapansgat. A new computer imaging technique is described that "reconstructs" the missing portions of the endocranial cavity in order to determine endocranial capacity. In addition, CT evaluation allows assessment of cranial venous outflow pattern even in cases where the endocranial cavity is completely filled with stone matrix. Results show that endocranial capacity in this specimen is less than originally proposed and also support the view that gracile and robust australopithecines evolved different cranial venous outflow patterns in response to upright postures.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The AP1 transcription factor Batf3 is required for homeostatic development of CD8&#206;&#177;(+) classical dendritic cells that prime CD8 T-cell responses against intracellular pathogens. Here we identify an alternative, Batf3-independent pathway in mice for CD8&#206;&#177;(+) dendritic cell development operating during infection with intracellular pathogens and mediated by the cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon-&#206;&#179;. This alternative pathway results from molecular compensation for Batf3 provided by the related AP1 factors Batf, which also functions in T and B cells, and Batf2 induced by cytokines in response to infection. Reciprocally, physiological compensation between Batf and Batf3 also occurs in T cells for expression of IL-10 and CTLA4. Compensation among BATF factors is based on the shared capacity of their leucine zipper domains to interact with non-AP1 factors such as IRF4 and IRF8 to mediate cooperative gene activation. Conceivably, manipulating this alternative pathway of dendritic cell development could be of value in augmenting immune responses to vaccines.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We report the results of whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples from 17 patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We identified 3,726 point mutations and more than 90 indels in the coding sequence, with an average mutation frequency more than 10-fold higher in smokers than in never-smokers. Novel alterations in genes involved in chromatin modification and DNA repair pathways were identified, along with DACH1, CFTR, RELN, ABCB5, and HGF. Deep digital sequencing revealed diverse clonality patterns in both never-smokers and smokers. All validated EFGR and KRAS mutations were present in the founder clones, suggesting possible roles in cancer initiation. Analysis revealed 14 fusions, including ROS1 and ALK, as well as novel metabolic enzymes. Cell-cycle and JAK-STAT pathways are significantly altered in lung cancer, along with perturbations in 54 genes that are potentially targetable with currently available drugs.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The human body is colonized by a vast array of microbes, which form communities of bacteria, viruses and microbial eukaryotes that are specific to each anatomical environment. Every community must be studied as a whole because many organisms have never been cultured independently, and this poses formidable challenges. The advent of next-generation DNA sequencing has allowed more sophisticated analysis and sampling of these complex systems by culture-independent methods. These methods are revealing differences in community structure between anatomical sites, between individuals, and between healthy and diseased states, and are transforming our view of human biology.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Reestablishing homeostasis after tissue damage depends on the proper organization of stem cells and their progeny, though the repair mechanisms are unclear. The mammalian intestinal epithelium is well suited to approach this problem, as it is composed of well-delineated units called crypts of Lieberk&#195;&#188;hn. We found that Wnt5a, a noncanonical Wnt ligand, was required for crypt regeneration after injury in mice. Unlike controls, Wnt5a-deficient mice maintained an expanded population of proliferative epithelial cells in the wound. We used an in vitro system to enrich for intestinal epithelial stem cells to discover that Wnt5a inhibited proliferation of these cells. Surprisingly, the effects of Wnt5a were mediated by activation of transforming growth factor-&#206;&#178; (TGF-&#206;&#178;) signaling. These findings suggest a Wnt5a-dependent mechanism for forming new crypt units to reestablish homeostasis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Individual neurons in the brain send their axons over considerable distances to multiple targets, but the mechanisms governing this process are unresolved. An amenable system for studying axon outgrowth, branching, and target selection is the mammalian corticopontine projection. This major connection develops from parent corticospinal axons that have already grown past the pons, by a delayed interstitial budding of collateral branches that then grow directly into their target, the basilar pons. When cocultured with explants of developing cortex in three-dimensional collagen matrices, the basilar pons elicits the formation and directional growth of cortical axon collaterals across the intervening matrix. This effect appears to be target-specific and selectively influences neurons in the appropriate cortical layer. These in vitro findings provide evidence that the basilar pons becomes innervated by controlling at a distance the budding and directed ingrowth of cortical axon collaterals through the release of a diffusible, chemotropic molecule.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Incubation of a 90-kilodalton ferritin repressor protein (FRP), either free or complexed with an L-ferritin transcript, with hemin or Co3+-protoporphyrin IX prevented subsequent repression of ferritin synthesis in a wheat germ extract. Neither FeCl3 in combinations with H2O2, nor Fe3+ or Fe2+ chelated with EDTA, nor Zn2+-protoporphyrin IX, nor protoporphyrin IX caused significant inactivation of FRP. FRP that had been inactivated by hemin remained chemically intact, as revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Inclusion of chelators of iron or free radical scavengers did not alter the inactivation produced by hemin. These and other results indicate that hemin derepresses ferritin synthesis in vitro.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Soil microbiota represent one of the ancient evolutionary origins of antibiotic resistance and have been proposed as a reservoir of resistance genes available for exchange with clinical pathogens. Using a high-throughput functional metagenomic approach in conjunction with a pipeline for the de novo assembly of short-read sequence data from functional selections (termed PARFuMS), we provide evidence for recent exchange of antibiotic resistance genes between environmental bacteria and clinical pathogens. We describe multidrug-resistant soil bacteria containing resistance cassettes against five classes of antibiotics (&#206;&#178;-lactams, aminoglycosides, amphenicols, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines) that have perfect nucleotide identity to genes from diverse human pathogens. This identity encompasses noncoding regions as well as multiple mobilization sequences, offering not only evidence of lateral exchange but also a mechanism by which antibiotic resistance disseminates.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The kinematic strategy encoded in motor cortical areas for classic straight-line reaching is remarkably simple and consistent across subjects, despite the complicated musculoskeletal dynamics that are involved. As tasks become more challenging, however, different conscious strategies may be used to improve perceived behavioral performance. We identified additional spatial information that appeared both in single neurons and in the population code of monkey dorsal premotor cortex when obstacles impeded direct reach paths. The neural correlate of movement planning varied between subjects in a manner consistent with the use of different strategies to optimize task completion. These distinct planning strategies were manifested in the timing and strength of the information contained in the neural population code.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Most mutations in cancer genomes are thought to be acquired after the initiating event, which may cause genomic instability and drive clonal evolution. However, for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), normal karyotypes are common, and genomic instability is unusual. To better understand clonal evolution in AML, we sequenced the genomes of M3-AML samples with a known initiating event (PML-RARA) versus the genomes of normal karyotype M1-AML samples and the exomes of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy people. Collectively, the data suggest that most of the mutations found in AML genomes are actually random events that occurred in HSPCs before they acquired the initiating mutation; the mutational history of that cell is "captured" as the clone expands. In many cases, only one or two additional, cooperating mutations are needed to generate the malignant founding clone. Cells from the founding clone can acquire additional cooperating mutations, yielding subclones that can contribute to disease progression and/or relapse.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Medulloblastoma is a malignant childhood brain tumour comprising four discrete subgroups. Here, to identify mutations that drive medulloblastoma, we sequenced the entire genomes of 37 tumours and matched normal blood. One-hundred and thirty-six genes harbouring somatic mutations in this discovery set were sequenced in an additional 56 medulloblastomas. Recurrent mutations were detected in 41 genes not yet implicated in medulloblastoma; several target distinct components of the epigenetic machinery in different disease subgroups, such as regulators of H3K27 and H3K4 trimethylation in subgroups 3 and 4 (for example, KDM6A and ZMYM3), and CTNNB1-associated chromatin re-modellers in WNT-subgroup tumours (for example, SMARCA4 and CREBBP). Modelling of mutations in mouse lower rhombic lip progenitors that generate WNT-subgroup tumours identified genes that maintain this cell lineage (DDX3X), as well as mutated genes that initiate (CDH1) or cooperate (PIK3CA) in tumorigenesis. These data provide important new insights into the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma subgroups and highlight targets for therapeutic development.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>To correlate the variable clinical features of oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer with somatic alterations, we studied pretreatment tumour biopsies accrued from patients in two studies of neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy by massively parallel sequencing and analysis. Eighteen significantly mutated genes were identified, including five genes (RUNX1, CBFB, MYH9, MLL3 and SF3B1) previously linked to haematopoietic disorders. Mutant MAP3K1 was associated with luminal A status, low-grade histology and low proliferation rates, whereas mutant TP53 was associated with the opposite pattern. Moreover, mutant GATA3 correlated with suppression of proliferation upon aromatase inhibitor treatment. Pathway analysis demonstrated that mutations in MAP2K4, a MAP3K1 substrate, produced similar perturbations as MAP3K1 loss. Distinct phenotypes in oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer are associated with specific patterns of somatic mutations that map into cellular pathways linked to tumour biology, but most recurrent mutations are relatively infrequent. Prospective clinical trials based on these findings will require comprehensive genome sequencing.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A heparin binding mitogenic protein isolated from bovine uterus shares NH2-terminal amino acid sequence with a protein isolated from newborn rat brain. The cDNA's of the bovine, human, and rat genes have been isolated and encode extraordinarily conserved proteins unrelated to known growth or neurotrophic factors, although identity of nearly 50 percent has been found with the predicted sequence of a retinoic acid induced transcript in differentiating mouse embryonal carcinoma cells. Lysates of COS-7 cells transiently expressing this protein were mitogenic for NRK cells and initiated neurite outgrowth from mixed cultures of embryonic rat brain cells. RNA transcripts encoding this protein were widely distributed in tissues and were developmentally regulated. This protein, previously designated as heparin binding growth factor (HBGF)-8, is now renamed pleiotrophin (PTN) to reflect its diverse activities. PTN may be the first member of a family of developmentally regulated cytokines.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Gut microbial communities represent one source of human genetic and metabolic diversity. To examine how gut microbiomes differ among human populations, here we characterize bacterial species in fecal samples from 531 individuals, plus the gene content of 110 of them. The cohort encompassed healthy children and adults from the Amazonas of Venezuela, rural Malawi and US metropolitan areas and included mono- and dizygotic twins. Shared features of the functional maturation of the gut microbiome were identified during the first three years of life in all three populations, including age-associated changes in the genes involved in vitamin biosynthesis and metabolism. Pronounced differences in bacterial assemblages and functional gene repertoires were noted between US residents and those in the other two countries. These distinctive features are evident in early infancy as well as adulthood. Our findings underscore the need to consider the microbiome when evaluating human development, nutritional needs, physiological variations and the impact of westernization.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Evidence is mounting that extinctions are altering key processes important to the productivity and sustainability of Earth's ecosystems. Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes, but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition--two processes important in all ecosystems--are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21-40%) reduced plant production by 5-10%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41-60%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO(2) and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO(2) and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Acyl acid amido synthetases of the GH3 family act as critical prereceptor modulators of plant hormone action; however, the molecular basis for their hormone selectivity is unclear. Here, we report the crystal structures of benzoate-specific Arabidopsis thaliana AtGH3.12/PBS3 and jasmonic acid-specific AtGH3.11/JAR1. These structures, combined with biochemical analysis, define features for the conjugation of amino acids to diverse acyl acid substrates and highlight the importance of conformational changes in the carboxyl-terminal domain for catalysis. We also identify residues forming the acyl acid binding site across the GH3 family and residues critical for amino acid recognition. Our results demonstrate how a highly adaptable three-dimensional scaffold is used for the evolution of promiscuous activity across an enzyme family for modulation of plant signaling molecules.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A number of functionally important actions of proteins are mediated by short, intrinsically disordered peptide segments, but the molecular interactions that allow disordered domains to mediate their effects remain a topic of active investigation. Many K+ channel proteins, after initial channel opening, show a time-dependent reduction in current flux, termed 'inactivation', which involves movement of mobile cytosolic peptide segments (approximately 20-30 residues) into a position that physically occludes ion permeation. Peptide segments that produce inactivation show little amino-acid identity and tolerate appreciable mutational substitutions without disrupting the inactivation process. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance of several isolated inactivation domains reveals substantial conformational heterogeneity with only minimal tendency to ordered structures. Channel inactivation mechanisms may therefore help us to decipher how intrinsically disordered regions mediate functional effects. Whereas many aspects of inactivation of voltage-dependent K+ channels (Kv) can be described by a simple one-step occlusion mechanism, inactivation of the voltage-dependent large-conductance Ca2+-gated K+ (BK) channel mediated by peptide segments of auxiliary &#206;&#178;-subunits involves two distinguishable kinetic steps. Here we show that two-step inactivation mediated by an intrinsically disordered BK &#206;&#178;-subunit peptide involves a stereospecific binding interaction that precedes blockade. In contrast, blocking mediated by a Shaker Kv inactivation peptide is consistent with direct, simple occlusion by a hydrophobic segment without substantial steric requirement. The results indicate that two distinct types of molecular interaction between disordered peptide segments and their binding sites produce qualitatively similar functions.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The t(14; 18) chromosomal translocation of human follicular B-cell lymphoma juxtaposes the bcl-2 gene with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. The bcl-2 immunoglobulin fusion gene is markedly deregulated resulting in inappropriately elevated levels of bcl-2 RNA and protein. Transgenic mice bearing a bcl-2 immunoglobulin minigene demonstrate a polyclonal expansion of resting yet responsive IgM-IgD B cells which display prolonged cell survival but no increase in cell cycling. Moreover, deregulated bcl-2 extends the survival of certain haematopoietic cell lines following growth-factor deprivation. By using immunolocalization studies we now demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein of relative molecular mass 25,000 (25k). Overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks the apoptotic death of a pro-B-lymphocyte cell line. Thus, Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and interfering with programmed cell death independent of promoting cell division.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) can create multiscale multicontrast images of living biological structures ranging from organelles to organs. This emerging technology overcomes the high degree of scattering of optical photons in biological tissue by making use of the photoacoustic effect. Light absorption by molecules creates a thermally induced pressure jump that launches ultrasonic waves, which are received by acoustic detectors to form images. Different implementations of PAT allow the spatial resolution to be scaled with the desired imaging depth in tissue while a high depth-to-resolution ratio is maintained. As a rule of thumb, the achievable spatial resolution is on the order of 1/200 of the desired imaging depth, which can reach up to 7 centimeters. PAT provides anatomical, functional, metabolic, molecular, and genetic contrasts of vasculature, hemodynamics, oxygen metabolism, biomarkers, and gene expression. We review the state of the art of PAT for both biological and clinical studies and discuss future prospects.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although caused by vastly different pathogens, the world's three most serious infectious diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV-1 infection, share the common problem of drug resistance. The pace of drug development has been very slow for tuberculosis and malaria and rapid for HIV-1. But for each disease, resistance to most drugs has appeared quickly after the introduction of the drug. Learning how to manage and prevent resistance is a major medical challenge that requires an understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of each pathogen. This Review summarizes the similarities and differences in the evolution of drug resistance for these three pathogens.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The intestinal immune system is exposed to a mixture of foreign antigens from diet, commensal flora and potential pathogens. Understanding how pathogen-specific immunity is elicited while avoiding inappropriate responses to the background of innocuous antigens is essential for understanding and treating intestinal infections and inflammatory diseases. The ingestion of protein antigen can induce oral tolerance, which is mediated in part by a subset of intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) that promote the development of regulatory T cells. The lamina propria (LP) underlies the expansive single-cell absorptive villous epithelium and contains a large population of DCs (CD11c(+) CD11b(+) MHCII(+) cells) comprised of two predominant subsets: CD103(+) CX(3)CR1(-) DCs, which promote IgA production, imprint gut homing on lymphocytes and induce the development of regulatory T cells, and CD103(-) CX(3)CR1(+) DCs (with features of macrophages), which promote tumour necrosis factor-&#206;&#177; (TNF-&#206;&#177;) production, colitis, and the development of T(H)17 T cells. However, the mechanisms by which different intestinal LP-DC subsets capture luminal antigens in vivo remains largely unexplored. Using a minimally disruptive in vivo imaging approach we show that in the steady state, small intestine goblet cells (GCs) function as passages delivering low molecular weight soluble antigens from the intestinal lumen to underlying CD103(+) LP-DCs. The preferential delivery of antigens to DCs with tolerogenic properties implies a key role for this GC function in intestinal immune homeostasis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Cancer immunoediting, the process by which the immune system controls tumour outgrowth and shapes tumour immunogenicity, is comprised of three phases: elimination, equilibrium and escape. Although many immune components that participate in this process are known, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. A central tenet of cancer immunoediting is that T-cell recognition of tumour antigens drives the immunological destruction or sculpting of a developing cancer. However, our current understanding of tumour antigens comes largely from analyses of cancers that develop in immunocompetent hosts and thus may have already been edited. Little is known about the antigens expressed in nascent tumour cells, whether they are sufficient to induce protective antitumour immune responses or whether their expression is modulated by the immune system. Here, using massively parallel sequencing, we characterize expressed mutations in highly immunogenic methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas derived from immunodeficient Rag2(-/-) mice that phenotypically resemble nascent primary tumour cells. Using class I prediction algorithms, we identify mutant spectrin-&#206;&#178;2 as a potential rejection antigen of the d42m1 sarcoma and validate this prediction by conventional antigen expression cloning and detection. We also demonstrate that cancer immunoediting of d42m1 occurs via a T-cell-dependent immunoselection process that promotes outgrowth of pre-existing tumour cell clones lacking highly antigenic mutant spectrin-&#206;&#178;2 and other potential strong antigens. These results demonstrate that the strong immunogenicity of an unedited tumour can be ascribed to expression of highly antigenic mutant proteins and show that outgrowth of tumour cells that lack these strong antigens via a T-cell-dependent immunoselection process represents one mechanism of cancer immunoediting.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The unprecedented resolution of high-throughput genomics has enabled the recent discovery of a phenomenon by which specific regions of the genome are shattered and then stitched together via a single devastating event, referred to as chromothripsis. Potential mechanisms governing this process are now emerging, with implications for our understanding of the role of genomic rearrangements in development and disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Studies of phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways are entering a new phase in which molecular genetic techniques are providing powerful tools to dissect the functions of various metabolites and pathways. Studies with phospholipase C are most advanced and clearly indicate that phosphatidylinositol turnover is critical for vision in Drosophila and cell proliferation in various cultured cells. Expression of cDNA constructs and microinjection of PLC or antibodies against it clearly establish a role for PtdIns signaling distinct from its role in calcium mobilization and protein kinase C activation. The importance of inositol cyclic phosphates is also beginning to be realized from the study of cyclic hydrolase using similar techniques. Elucidation of the function of the 3-phosphate inositol phospholipid pathway awaits similar studies. The recent cDNA cloning of inositol monophosphatase (Diehl et al., 1990), Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase (Choi et al., 1990), and inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (York and Majerus, 1991) should provide tools to define further the cell biology of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Most patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) die from progressive disease after relapse, which is associated with clonal evolution at the cytogenetic level. To determine the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, we sequenced the primary tumour and relapse genomes from eight AML patients, and validated hundreds of somatic mutations using deep sequencing; this allowed us to define clonality and clonal evolution patterns precisely at relapse. In addition to discovering novel, recurrently mutated genes (for example, WAC, SMC3, DIS3, DDX41 and DAXX) in AML, we also found two major clonal evolution patterns during AML relapse: (1) the founding clone in the primary tumour gained mutations and evolved into the relapse clone, or (2) a subclone of the founding clone survived initial therapy, gained additional mutations and expanded at relapse. In all cases, chemotherapy failed to eradicate the founding clone. The comparison of relapse-specific versus primary tumour mutations in all eight cases revealed an increase in transversions, probably due to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that AML relapse is associated with the addition of new mutations and clonal evolution, which is shaped, in part, by the chemotherapy that the patients receive to establish and maintain remissions.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A general strategy for cloning and mapping large regions of human DNA with yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC's) is described. It relies on the use of the polymerase chain reaction to detect DNA landmarks called sequence-tagged sites (STS's) within YAC clones. The method was applied to the region of human chromosome 7 containing the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene. Thirty YAC clones from this region were analyzed, and a contig map that spans more than 1,500,000 base pairs was assembled. Individual YAC's as large as 790 kilobase pairs and containing the entire CF gene were constructed in vivo by meiotic recombination in yeast between pairs of overlapping YAC's.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Small multidrug resistance transporters provide an ideal system to study the minimal requirements for active transport. EmrE is one such transporter in Escherichia coli. It exports a broad class of polyaromatic cation substrates, thus conferring resistance to drug compounds matching this chemical description. However, a great deal of controversy has surrounded the topology of the EmrE homodimer. Here we show that asymmetric antiparallel EmrE exchanges between inward- and outward-facing states that are identical except that they have opposite orientation in the membrane. We quantitatively measure the global conformational exchange between these two states for substrate-bound EmrE in bicelles using solution NMR dynamics experiments. F&#195;&#182;rster resonance energy transfer reveals that the monomers within each dimer are antiparallel, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR experiments demonstrate differential water accessibility of the two monomers within each dimer. Our experiments reveal a 'dynamic symmetry' that reconciles the asymmetric EmrE structure with the functional symmetry of residues in the active site.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Spinal opioid-induced itch, a prevalent side effect of pain management, has been proposed to result from pain inhibition. We now report that the &#206;&#188;-opioid receptor (MOR) isoform MOR1D is essential for morphine-induced scratching (MIS), whereas the isoform MOR1 is required only for morphine-induced analgesia (MIA). MOR1D heterodimerizes with gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) in the spinal cord, relaying itch information. We show that morphine triggers internalization of both GRPR and MOR1D, whereas GRP specifically triggers GRPR internalization and morphine-independent scratching. Providing potential insight into opioid-induced itch prevention, we demonstrate that molecular and pharmacologic inhibition of PLC&#206;&#178;3 and IP3R3, downstream effectors of GRPR, specifically block MIS but not MIA. In addition, blocking MOR1D-GRPR association attenuates MIS but not MIA. Together, these data suggest that opioid-induced itch is an active process concomitant with but independent of opioid analgesia, occurring via the unidirectional cross-activation of GRPR signaling by MOR1D heterodimerization.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The microbiome is a complex community of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya, and viruses that infect humans and live in our tissues. It contributes the majority of genetic information to our metagenome and, consequently, influences our resistance and susceptibility to diseases, especially common inflammatory diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. Here we discuss how host-gene-microbial interactions are major determinants for the development of these multifactorial chronic disorders and, thus, for the relationship between genotype and phenotype. We also explore how genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are uncovering mechanism-based subtypes for these disorders. Applying these emerging concepts will permit a more complete understanding of the etiologies of complex diseases and underpin the development of both next-generation animal models and new therapeutic strategies for targeting personalized disease phenotypes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The instruction of the immune system to be tolerant of self, thereby preventing autoimmunity, is facilitated by the education of T cells in a specialized organ, the thymus, in which self-reactive cells are either eliminated or differentiated into tolerogenic Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T(reg)) cells. However, it is unknown whether T cells are also educated to be tolerant of foreign antigens, such as those from commensal bacteria, to prevent immunopathology such as inflammatory bowel disease. Here we show that encounter with commensal microbiota results in the peripheral generation of T(reg) cells rather than pathogenic effectors. We observed that colonic T(reg) cells used T-cell antigen receptors (TCRs) different from those used by T(reg) cells in other locations, implying an important role for local antigens in shaping the colonic T(reg)-cell population. Many of the local antigens seemed to be derived from commensal bacteria, on the basis of the in vitro reactivity of common colon T(reg) TCRs. These TCRs did not facilitate thymic T(reg)-cell development, implying that many colonic T(reg) cells arise instead by means of antigen-driven peripheral T(reg)-cell development. Further analysis of two of these TCRs by the creation of retroviral bone marrow chimaeras and a TCR transgenic line revealed that microbiota indigenous to our mouse colony was required for the generation of colonic T(reg) cells from otherwise naive T cells. If T cells expressing these TCRs fail to undergo T(reg)-cell development and instead become effector cells, they have the potential to induce colitis, as evidenced by adoptive transfer studies. These results suggest that the efficient peripheral generation of antigen-specific populations of T(reg) cells in response to an individual's microbiota provides important post-thymic education of the immune system to foreign antigens, thereby providing tolerance to commensal microbiota.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>After systemic administration to immature rodents, L-cysteine destroys neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and striatum, but the underlying mechanism has never been clarified. This neurotoxicity of L-cysteine, in vitro or in vivo, has now been shown to be mediated primarily through the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor (with quisqualate receptor participation at higher concentrations). In addition, the excitotoxic potency of L-cysteine was substantially increased in the presence of physiological concentrations of bicarbonate ion. L-Cysteine is naturally present in the human brain and in the environment, and is much more powerful than beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine, a bicarbonate-dependent excitotoxin, which has been implicated in an adult neurodegenerative disorder endemic to Guam. Thus, the potential involvement of this common sulfur-containing amino acid in neurodegenerative processes affecting the central nervous system warrants consideration.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Capping protein controls the addition of actin subunits to the barbed end of actin filaments and nucleates actin polymerization in vitro. Capping protein has been identified in all eukaryotic cells examined so far; it is a heterodimer with subunits of relative molecular masses 32,000-36,000 (alpha-subunit) and 28,000-32,000 (beta-subunit). In skeletal muscle, capping protein (CapZ) probably binds the barbed ends of actin filaments at the Z line. The in vivo role of this protein in non-muscle cells is not known. We report here the characterization of CAP2, the single gene encoding the beta-subunit of capping protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast cells in which the CAP2 gene was disrupted by an insertion or a deletion had an abnormal actin distribution, including the loss of actin cables. The mutant cells were round and large, with a heterogeneous size distribution, and, although viable, grew more slowly than congenic wild-type cells. Chitin, a cell wall component restricted to the mother-bud junction in wild-type budding yeast, was found on the entire mother cell surface in the mutants. The phenotype of CAP2 disruption resembled that of temperature-sensitive mutations in the yeast actin gene ACT1, indicating that capping protein regulates actin-filament distribution in vivo.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Manicassamy et al. (Reports, 13 August 2010, p. 849) deleted &#206;&#178;-catenin in intestinal immune cells using a CD11c-driven Cre recombinase, which decreased anti-inflammatory mediators and increased inflammatory bowel disease. However, the deletion of &#206;&#178;-catenin in macrophages remains a caveat to their interpretation that Wnt signaling programs dendritic cells into a tolerogenic state. Development of strains expressing Cre in a more finely lineage-restricted pattern may help resolve this issue.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Sleep is believed to play an important role in memory consolidation. We induced sleep on demand by expressing the temperature-gated nonspecific cation channel Transient receptor potential cation channel (UAS-TrpA1) in neurons, including those with projections to the dorsal fan-shaped body (FB). When the temperature was raised to 31&#194;&#176;C, flies entered a quiescent state that meets the criteria for identifying sleep. When sleep was induced for 4 hours after a massed-training protocol for courtship conditioning that is not capable of inducing long-term memory (LTM) by itself, flies develop an LTM. Activating the dorsal FB in the absence of sleep did not result in the formation of LTM after massed training.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Lysosomal enzymes contain a common protein determinant that is recognized by UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, the initial enzyme in the formation of mannose 6-phosphate residues. To identify this protein determinant, we constructed chimeric molecules between two aspartyl proteases: cathepsin D, a lysosomal enzyme, and pepsinogen, a secretory protein. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the oligosaccharides of cathepsin D were efficiently phosphorylated, whereas the oligosaccharides of a glycosylated form of pepsinogen were not phosphorylated. The combined substitution of two noncontinuous sequences of cathepsin D (lysine 203 and amino acids 265-292) into the analogous positions of glycopepsinogen resulted in phosphorylation of the oligosaccharides of the expressed chimeric molecule. These two sequences are in direct apposition on the surface of the molecule, indicating that amino acids from different regions come together in three-dimensional space to form this recognition domain. Other regions of cathepsin D were identified that may be components of a more extensive recognition marker.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Coevolution of mammals and their gut microbiota has profoundly affected their radiation into myriad habitats. We used shotgun sequencing of microbial community DNA and targeted sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes to gain an understanding of how microbial communities adapt to extremes of diet. We sampled fecal DNA from 33 mammalian species and 18 humans who kept detailed diet records, and we found that the adaptation of the microbiota to diet is similar across different mammalian lineages. Functional repertoires of microbiome genes, such as those encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes and proteases, can be predicted from bacterial species assemblages. These results illustrate the value of characterizing vertebrate gut microbiomes to understand host evolutionary histories at a supraorganismal level.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The interrelationships between our diets and the structure and operations of our gut microbial communities are poorly understood. A model community of 10 sequenced human gut bacteria was introduced into gnotobiotic mice, and changes in species abundance and microbial gene expression were measured in response to randomized perturbations of four defined ingredients in the host diet. From the responses, we developed a statistical model that predicted over 60% of the variation in species abundance evoked by diet perturbations, and we were able to identify which factors in the diet best explained changes seen for each community member. The approach is generally applicable, as shown by a follow-up study involving diets containing various mixtures of pureed human baby foods.</p>

Lipocortin III has also been previously identified as placental anticoagulant protein III (PAP III) and calcimedin 35 alpha. Antibodies to PAP III detected PAP III and inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate 2-phosphohydrolase with identical reactivity on immunoblotting.

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum are thought to bind peptides of foreign and endogenous antigens. Several lines of evidence indicate that beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2m) and/or peptide ligand participate in the intracellular transport and surface expression of class I molecules, but the nature of their involvement is still unclear. Here we present evidence that culturing non-mutant cells (fibroblast, thymoma or mastocytoma) with a peptide ligand specific for the Ld class I molecule of the mouse leads to a dramatic (fourfold) and specific induction of Ld surface expression. Surprisingly, this peptide ligand-induced expression of Ld does not result in an increased intracellular association of Ld with beta 2m. These findings demonstrate that the previously reported decrease in surface expression of Ld results from its failure to be saturated with endogenous self-peptide ligands. This unique feature of Ld could also contribute to the fact that several virus-specific cytotoxic T cell responses have been found to be Ld-restricted.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Comparing photosynthetic and photovoltaic efficiencies is not a simple issue. Although both processes harvest the energy in sunlight, they operate in distinctly different ways and produce different types of products: biomass or chemical fuels in the case of natural photosynthesis and nonstored electrical current in the case of photovoltaics. In order to find common ground for evaluating energy-conversion efficiency, we compare natural photosynthesis with present technologies for photovoltaic-driven electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen. Photovoltaic-driven electrolysis is the more efficient process when measured on an annual basis, yet short-term yields for photosynthetic conversion under optimal conditions come within a factor of 2 or 3 of the photovoltaic benchmark. We consider opportunities in which the frontiers of synthetic biology might be used to enhance natural photosynthesis for improved solar energy conversion efficiency.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Substance P is a member of the tachykinin peptide family and participates in the regulation of diverse biological processes. The polymerase chain reaction and conventional library screening were used to isolate a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the rat substance P receptor from brain and submandibular gland. By homology analysis, this receptor belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The receptor cDNA was expressed in a mammalian cell line and the ligand binding properties of the encoded receptor were pharmacologically defined by Scatchard analysis and tachykinin peptide displacement as those of a substance P receptor. The distribution of the messenger RNA for this receptor is highest in urinary bladder, submandibular gland, striatum, and spinal cord, which is consistent with the known distribution of substance P receptor binding sites. Thus, this receptor appears to mediate the primary actions of substance P in various brain regions and peripheral tissues.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Communication can contribute to the evolution of biodiversity by promoting speciation and reinforcing reproductive isolation between existing species. The evolution of species-specific signals depends on the ability of individuals to detect signal variation, which in turn relies on the capability of the brain to process signal information. Here, we show that evolutionary change in a region of the brain devoted to the analysis of communication signals in mormyrid electric fishes improved detection of subtle signal variation and resulted in enhanced rates of signal evolution and species diversification. These results show that neural innovations can drive the diversification of signals and promote speciation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Understanding how the immune system affects cancer development and progression has been one of the most challenging questions in immunology. Research over the past two decades has helped explain why the answer to this question has evaded us for so long. We now appreciate that the immune system plays a dual role in cancer: It can not only suppress tumor growth by destroying cancer cells or inhibiting their outgrowth but also promote tumor progression either by selecting for tumor cells that are more fit to survive in an immunocompetent host or by establishing conditions within the tumor microenvironment that facilitate tumor outgrowth. Here, we discuss a unifying conceptual framework called "cancer immunoediting," which integrates the immune system's dual host-protective and tumor-promoting roles.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>What is the origin of the forces generating chromosome and spindle movements in mitosis? Both microtubule dynamics and microtubule-dependent motors have been proposed as the source of these motor forces. Cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin are two soluble proteins that power membranous organelle movements on microtubules. Kinesin directs movement of organelles to the 'plus' end of microtubules, and is found at the mitotic spindle in sea urchin embryos, but not in mammalian cells. Cytoplasmic dynein translocates organelles to the 'minus' end of microtubules, and is composed of two heavy chains and several light chains. We report here that monoclonal antibodies to two of these subunits and to another polypeptide that associates with dynein localize the protein to the mitotic spindle and to the kinetochores of isolated chromosomes, suggesting that cytoplasmic dynein is important in powering movements of the spindle and chromosomes in dividing cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The relationships among the living apes and modern humans have effectively been resolved, but it is much more difficult to locate fossil apes on the tree of life because shared skeletal morphology does not always mean shared recent evolutionary history. Sorting fossil taxa into those that belong on the branch of the tree of life that leads to modern humans from those that belong on other closely related branches is a considerable challenge.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>'Orang-utan' is derived from a Malay term meaning 'man of the forest' and aptly describes the southeast Asian great apes native to Sumatra and Borneo. The orang-utan species, Pongo abelii (Sumatran) and Pongo pygmaeus (Bornean), are the most phylogenetically distant great apes from humans, thereby providing an informative perspective on hominid evolution. Here we present a Sumatran orang-utan draft genome assembly and short read sequence data from five Sumatran and five Bornean orang-utan genomes. Our analyses reveal that, compared to other primates, the orang-utan genome has many unique features. Structural evolution of the orang-utan genome has proceeded much more slowly than other great apes, evidenced by fewer rearrangements, less segmental duplication, a lower rate of gene family turnover and surprisingly quiescent Alu repeats, which have played a major role in restructuring other primate genomes. We also describe a primate polymorphic neocentromere, found in both Pongo species, emphasizing the gradual evolution of orang-utan genome structure. Orang-utans have extremely low energy usage for a eutherian mammal, far lower than their hominid relatives. Adding their genome to the repertoire of sequenced primates illuminates new signals of positive selection in several pathways including glycolipid metabolism. From the population perspective, both Pongo species are deeply diverse; however, Sumatran individuals possess greater diversity than their Bornean counterparts, and more species-specific variation. Our estimate of Bornean/Sumatran speciation time, 400,000&#226;&#128;&#137;years ago, is more recent than most previous studies and underscores the complexity of the orang-utan speciation process. Despite a smaller modern census population size, the Sumatran effective population size (N(e)) expanded exponentially relative to the ancestral N(e) after the split, while Bornean N(e) declined over the same period. Overall, the resources and analyses presented here offer new opportunities in evolutionary genomics, insights into hominid biology, and an extensive database of variation for conservation efforts.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In order to examine the mechanisms by which clonal deletion of autoreactive T cells occurs, a peptide antigen was used to induce deletion of antigen-reactive thymocytes in vivo. Mice transgenic for a T cell receptor (TCR) that reacts to this peptide contain thymocytes that progress from the immature to the mature phenotype. Intraperitoneal administration of the peptide antigen to transgenic mice results in a rapid deletion of the immature CD4+ CD8+ TCRlo thymocytes. Apoptosis of cortical thymocytes can be seen within 20 hours of treatment. These results provide direct evidence for the in vivo role of apoptosis in the development of antigen-induced tolerance.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated by the recombination activating gene (RAG) endonuclease in all developing lymphocytes as they assemble antigen receptor genes. DNA cleavage by RAG occurs only at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and generates two hairpin-sealed DNA (coding) ends that require nucleolytic opening before their repair by classical non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Although there are several cellular nucleases that could perform this function, only the Artemis nuclease is able to do so efficiently. Here, in vivo, we show that in murine cells the histone protein H2AX prevents nucleases other than Artemis from processing hairpin-sealed coding ends; in the absence of H2AX, CtIP can efficiently promote the hairpin opening and resection of DNA ends generated by RAG cleavage. This CtIP-mediated resection is inhibited by &#206;&#179;-H2AX and by MDC-1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1), which binds to &#206;&#179;-H2AX in chromatin flanking DNA DSBs. Moreover, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activates antagonistic pathways that modulate this resection. CtIP DNA end resection activity is normally limited to cells at post-replicative stages of the cell cycle, in which it is essential for homology-mediated repair. In G1-phase lymphocytes, DNA ends that are processed by CtIP are not efficiently joined by classical NHEJ and the joints that do form frequently use micro-homologies and show significant chromosomal deletions. Thus, H2AX preserves the structural integrity of broken DNA ends in G1-phase lymphocytes, thereby preventing these DNA ends from accessing repair pathways that promote genomic instability.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The number of specific complexes formed between peptide and the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed by an antigen-presenting cell (APC) after exposure to protein antigens is unknown, as is the number that activates T cells. Presentation of foreign peptides by APC takes place when many class II molecules may be occupied by autologous peptides. We have now estimated the number of specific peptide/class II complexes per APC by quantitative immunoprecipitation of I-Ak after pulsing the APC with stimulatory levels of a radioactive immunogenic peptide derived from hen egg-white lysozyme protein. T cells were activated by APC that expressed as few as 210-340 specific peptide/class II complexes (0.1% of the I-Ak molecules). These figures were confirmed using anti-CD3 antibody bound to latex beads as an alternative activating ligand. This low number explains the simultaneous presentation of multiple foreign antigens, even in the face of peptide competition.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Alzheimer's disease is hypothesized to be caused by an imbalance between &#206;&#178;-amyloid (A&#206;&#178;) production and clearance that leads to A&#206;&#178; accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS). A&#206;&#178; production and clearance are key targets in the development of disease-modifying therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease. However, there has not been direct evidence of altered A&#206;&#178; production or clearance in Alzheimer's disease. By using metabolic labeling, we measured A&#206;&#178;42 and A&#206;&#178;40 production and clearance rates in the CNS of participants with Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal controls. Clearance rates for both A&#206;&#178;42 and A&#206;&#178;40 were impaired in Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. On average, there were no differences in A&#206;&#178;40 or A&#206;&#178;42 production rates. Thus, the common late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease is characterized by an overall impairment in A&#206;&#178; clearance.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although the proteins BAX and BAK are required for initiation of apoptosis at the mitochondria, how BAX and BAK are activated remains unsettled. We provide in vivo evidence demonstrating an essential role of the proteins BID, BIM, and PUMA in activating BAX and BAK. Bid, Bim, and Puma triple-knockout mice showed the same developmental defects that are associated with deficiency of Bax and Bak, including persistent interdigital webs and imperforate vaginas. Genetic deletion of Bid, Bim, and Puma prevented the homo-oligomerization of BAX and BAK, and thereby cytochrome c-mediated activation of caspases in response to diverse death signals in neurons and T lymphocytes, despite the presence of other BH3-only molecules. Thus, many forms of apoptosis require direct activation of BAX and BAK at the mitochondria by a member of the BID, BIM, or PUMA family of proteins.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>An inhibitor of coagulation factor XIa was purified from serum-free conditioned medium of HepG2 liver cells. Platelets stimulated with thrombin or calcium ionophore (A23187) secrete a protein functionally and immunologically identical to the inhibitor, implying a role for this inhibitor in hemostasis. Analysis of the amino-terminal amino acid sequence and immunologic reactivity showed the inhibitor to be a truncated form of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein that contains a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor domain and at least a portion of the amyloid beta protein. It inhibits factor XIa and trypsin with a Ki of 450 +/- 50 pM and 20 +/- 10 pM, respectively. Heparin (1 unit/ml) did not significantly effect inhibition of trypsin, but inhibition of XIa was 15 times greater (Ki = 25 +/- 15 pM) in the presence of heparin.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) of higher eukaryotes and many viral RNAs are methylated at the N-7 and 2'-O positions of the 5' guanosine cap by specific nuclear and cytoplasmic methyltransferases (MTases), respectively. Whereas N-7 methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability, the function of 2'-O methylation has remained uncertain since its discovery 35 years ago. Here we show that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant (E218A) that lacks 2'-O MTase activity was attenuated in wild-type primary cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of type I interferon (IFN) signalling. 2'-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNV-infected fibroblasts but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), which are interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) implicated in regulation of protein translation. Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 2'-O MTase activity similarly showed enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFN and, specifically, IFIT proteins. Our results demonstrate that the 2'-O methylation of the 5' cap of viral RNA functions to subvert innate host antiviral responses through escape of IFIT-mediated suppression, and suggest an evolutionary explanation for 2'-O methylation of cellular mRNA: to distinguish self from non-self RNA. Differential methylation of cytoplasmic RNA probably serves as an example for pattern recognition and restriction of propagation of foreign viral RNA in host cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Metastasis is a defining feature of malignant tumors and is the most common cause of cancer-related death, yet the genetics of metastasis are poorly understood. We used exome capture coupled with massively parallel sequencing to search for metastasis-related mutations in highly metastatic uveal melanomas of the eye. Inactivating somatic mutations were identified in the gene encoding BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) on chromosome 3p21.1 in 26 of 31 (84%) metastasizing tumors, including 15 mutations causing premature protein termination and 5 affecting its ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase domain. One tumor harbored a frameshift mutation that was germline in origin, thus representing a susceptibility allele. These findings implicate loss of BAP1 in uveal melanoma metastasis and suggest that the BAP1 pathway may be a valuable therapeutic target.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Group functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) studies have documented reliable changes in human functional brain maturity over development. Here we show that support vector machine-based multivariate pattern analysis extracts sufficient information from fcMRI data to make accurate predictions about individuals' brain maturity across development. The use of only 5 minutes of resting-state fcMRI data from 238 scans of typically developing volunteers (ages 7 to 30 years) allowed prediction of individual brain maturity as a functional connectivity maturation index. The resultant functional maturation curve accounted for 55% of the sample variance and followed a nonlinear asymptotic growth curve shape. The greatest relative contribution to predicting individual brain maturity was made by the weakening of short-range functional connections between the adult brain's major functional networks.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Cell cycle checkpoints are implemented to safeguard the genome, avoiding the accumulation of genetic errors. Checkpoint loss results in genomic instability and contributes to the evolution of cancer. Among G1-, S-, G2- and M-phase checkpoints, genetic studies indicate the role of an intact S-phase checkpoint in maintaining genome integrity. Although the basic framework of the S-phase checkpoint in multicellular organisms has been outlined, the mechanistic details remain to be elucidated. Human chromosome-11 band-q23 translocations disrupting the MLL gene lead to poor prognostic leukaemias. Here we assign MLL as a novel effector in the mammalian S-phase checkpoint network and identify checkpoint dysfunction as an underlying mechanism of MLL leukaemias. MLL is phosphorylated at serine 516 by ATR in response to genotoxic stress in the S phase, which disrupts its interaction with, and hence its degradation by, the SCF(Skp2) E3 ligase, leading to its accumulation. Stabilized MLL protein accumulates on chromatin, methylates histone H3 lysine 4 at late replication origins and inhibits the loading of CDC45 to delay DNA replication. Cells deficient in MLL showed radioresistant DNA synthesis and chromatid-type genomic abnormalities, indicative of S-phase checkpoint dysfunction. Reconstitution of Mll(-/-) (Mll also known as Mll1) mouse embryonic fibroblasts with wild-type but not S516A or &#206;&#148;SET mutant MLL rescues the S-phase checkpoint defects. Moreover, murine myeloid progenitor cells carrying an Mll-CBP knock-in allele that mimics human t(11;16) leukaemia show a severe radioresistant DNA synthesis phenotype. MLL fusions function as dominant negative mutants that abrogate the ATR-mediated phosphorylation/stabilization of wild-type MLL on damage to DNA, and thus compromise the S-phase checkpoint. Together, our results identify MLL as a key constituent of the mammalian DNA damage response pathway and show that deregulation of the S-phase checkpoint incurred by MLL translocations probably contributes to the pathogenesis of human MLL leukaemias.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Bacterial mRNAs often contain leader sequences that respond to specific metabolites or ions by altering expression of the associated downstream protein-coding sequences. Here we report that the leader RNA of the Mg(2+) transporter gene mgtA of Salmonella enterica, which was previously known to function as a Mg(2+)-sensing riboswitch, harbors an 18 codon proline-rich open reading frame-termed mgtL-that permits intracellular proline to regulate mgtA expression. Interfering with mgtL translation by genetic, pharmacological, or environmental means was observed to increase the mRNA levels from the mgtA coding region. Substitution of the mgtL proline codons by other codons abolished the response to proline and to hyperosmotic stress but not to Mg(2+). Our findings show that mRNA leader sequences can consist of complex regulatory elements that utilize different mechanisms to sense separate signals and mediate an appropriate cellular response.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Viral diversity and life cycles are poorly understood in the human gut and other body habitats. Phages and their encoded functions may provide informative signatures of a human microbiota and of microbial community responses to various disturbances, and may indicate whether community health or dysfunction is manifest after apparent recovery from a disease or therapeutic intervention. Here we report sequencing of the viromes (metagenomes) of virus-like particles isolated from faecal samples collected from healthy adult female monozygotic twins and their mothers at three time points over a one-year period. We compared these data sets with data sets of sequenced bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and total-faecal-community DNA. Co-twins and their mothers share a significantly greater degree of similarity in their faecal bacterial communities than do unrelated individuals. In contrast, viromes are unique to individuals regardless of their degree of genetic relatedness. Despite remarkable interpersonal variations in viromes and their encoded functions, intrapersonal diversity is very low, with &gt;95% of virotypes retained over the period surveyed, and with viromes dominated by a few temperate phages that exhibit remarkable genetic stability. These results indicate that a predatory viral-microbial dynamic, manifest in a number of other characterized environmental ecosystems, is notably absent in the very distal intestine.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>It is unclear why disease occurs in only a small proportion of persons carrying common risk alleles of disease susceptibility genes. Here we demonstrate that an interaction between a specific virus infection and a mutation in the Crohn's disease susceptibility gene Atg16L1 induces intestinal pathologies in mice. This virus-plus-susceptibility gene interaction generated abnormalities in granule packaging and unique patterns of gene expression in Paneth cells. Further, the response to injury induced by the toxic substance dextran sodium sulfate was fundamentally altered to include pathologies resembling aspects of Crohn's disease. These pathologies triggered by virus-plus-susceptibility gene interaction were dependent on TNFalpha and IFNgamma and were prevented by treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. Thus, we provide a specific example of how a virus-plus-susceptibility gene interaction can, in combination with additional environmental factors and commensal bacteria, determine the phenotype of hosts carrying common risk alleles for inflammatory disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Net primary productivity is a principal driver of biodiversity; large-scale regions with higher productivity generally have more species. This pattern emerges because beta-diversity (compositional variation across local sites) increases with productivity, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown. Using data from a long-term experiment in replicate ponds, I show that higher beta-diversity at higher productivity resulted from a stronger role for stochastic relative to deterministic assembly processes with increasing productivity. This shift in the relative importance of stochasticity was most consistent with the hypothesis of more intense priority effects leading to multiple stable equilibria at higher productivity. Thus, shifts in community assembly mechanisms across a productivity gradient may underlie one of the most prominent biodiversity gradients on the planet.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Calcium-regulated exocytosis is a ubiquitous process in eukaryotes, whereby secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents in response to an intracellular calcium surge. This process regulates various cellular functions such as plasma membrane repair in plants and animals, the discharge of defensive spikes in Paramecium, and the secretion of insulin from pancreatic cells, immune modulators from lymphocytes, and chemical transmitters from neurons. In animal cells, serine/threonine kinases including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C and calmodulin kinases have been implicated in calcium-signal transduction leading to regulated secretion. Although plants and protozoa also regulate secretion by means of intracellular calcium, the method by which these signals are relayed has not been explained. Here we show that the Toxoplasma gondii calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (TgCDPK1) is an essential regulator of calcium-dependent exocytosis in this opportunistic human pathogen. Conditional suppression of TgCDPK1 revealed that it controls calcium-dependent secretion of specialized organelles called micronemes, resulting in a block of essential phenotypes including parasite motility, host-cell invasion, and egress. These phenotypes were recapitulated by using a chemical biology approach in which pyrazolopyrimidine-derived compounds specifically inhibited TgCDPK1 and disrupted the parasite's life cycle at stages dependent on microneme secretion. Inhibition was specific to TgCDPK1, because expression of a resistant mutant kinase reversed sensitivity to the inhibitor. TgCDPK1 is conserved among apicomplexans and belongs to a family of kinases shared with plants and ciliates, suggesting that related CDPKs may have a function in calcium-regulated secretion in other organisms. Because this kinase family is absent from mammalian hosts, it represents a validated target that may be exploitable for chemotherapy against T. gondii and related apicomplexans.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>When the food intake of organisms such as yeast and rodents is reduced (dietary restriction), they live longer than organisms fed a normal diet. A similar effect is seen when the activity of nutrient-sensing pathways is reduced by mutations or chemical inhibitors. In rodents, both dietary restriction and decreased nutrient-sensing pathway activity can lower the incidence of age-related loss of function and disease, including tumors and neurodegeneration. Dietary restriction also increases life span and protects against diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease in rhesus monkeys, and in humans it causes changes that protect against these age-related pathologies. Tumors and diabetes are also uncommon in humans with mutations in the growth hormone receptor, and natural genetic variants in nutrient-sensing pathways are associated with increased human life span. Dietary restriction and reduced activity of nutrient-sensing pathways may thus slow aging by similar mechanisms, which have been conserved during evolution. We discuss these findings and their potential application to prevention of age-related disease and promotion of healthy aging in humans, and the challenge of possible negative side effects.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies provide an unprecedented ability to screen entire genomes for genetic changes associated with tumour progression. Here we describe the genomic analyses of four DNA samples from an African-American patient with basal-like breast cancer: peripheral blood, the primary tumour, a brain metastasis and a xenograft derived from the primary tumour. The metastasis contained two de novo mutations and a large deletion not present in the primary tumour, and was significantly enriched for 20 shared mutations. The xenograft retained all primary tumour mutations and displayed a mutation enrichment pattern that resembled the metastasis. Two overlapping large deletions, encompassing CTNNA1, were present in all three tumour samples. The differential mutation frequencies and structural variation patterns in metastasis and xenograft compared with the primary tumour indicate that secondary tumours may arise from a minority of cells within the primary tumour.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The zebra finch is an important model organism in several fields with unique relevance to human neuroscience. Like other songbirds, the zebra finch communicates through learned vocalizations, an ability otherwise documented only in humans and a few other animals and lacking in the chicken-the only bird with a sequenced genome until now. Here we present a structural, functional and comparative analysis of the genome sequence of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), which is a songbird belonging to the large avian order Passeriformes. We find that the overall structures of the genomes are similar in zebra finch and chicken, but they differ in many intrachromosomal rearrangements, lineage-specific gene family expansions, the number of long-terminal-repeat-based retrotransposons, and mechanisms of sex chromosome dosage compensation. We show that song behaviour engages gene regulatory networks in the zebra finch brain, altering the expression of long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, transcription factors and their targets. We also show evidence for rapid molecular evolution in the songbird lineage of genes that are regulated during song experience. These results indicate an active involvement of the genome in neural processes underlying vocal communication and identify potential genetic substrates for the evolution and regulation of this behaviour.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Developing a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine is critical to end the global acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, but many question whether this goal is achievable. Natural immunity is not protective, and despite immunogenicity of HIV vaccine candidates, human trials have exclusively yielded disappointing results. Nevertheless, there is an indication that success may be possible, but this will be dependent on understanding the antiviral immune response in unprecedented depth to identify and engineer the types of immunity required. Here we outline fundamental immunological questions that need to be answered to develop a protective HIV vaccine, and the immediate need to harness a much broader scientific community to achieve this goal.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>During their intraerythrocytic development, malaria parasites export hundreds of proteins to remodel their host cell. Nutrient acquisition, cytoadherence and antigenic variation are among the key virulence functions effected by this erythrocyte takeover. Proteins destined for export are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and cleaved at a conserved (PEXEL) motif, which allows translocation into the host cell via an ATP-driven translocon called the PTEX complex. We report that plasmepsin V, an ER aspartic protease with distant homology to the mammalian processing enzyme BACE, recognizes the PEXEL motif and cleaves it at the correct site. This enzyme is essential for parasite viability and ER residence is essential for its function. We propose that plasmepsin V is the PEXEL protease and is an attractive enzyme for antimalarial drug development.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The fossil record of Jurassic theropod dinosaurs closely related to birds remains poor. A new theropod from the earliest Late Jurassic of western China represents the earliest diverging member of the enigmatic theropod group Alvarezsauroidea and confirms that this group is a basal member of Maniraptora, the clade containing birds and their closest theropod relatives. It extends the fossil record of Alvarezsauroidea by 63 million years and provides evidence for maniraptorans earlier in the fossil record than Archaeopteryx. The new taxon confirms extreme morphological convergence between birds and derived alvarezsauroids and illuminates incipient stages of the highly modified alvarezsaurid forelimb.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Site-directed mutagenic replacement of M subunit Leu214 by His in the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides results in incorporation of a bacteriochlorophyll molecule (BChl) in place of the native bacteriopheophytin (BPh) electron acceptor. Evidence supporting this conclusion includes the ground-state absorption spectrum of the (M)L214H mutant, pigment and metal analyses, and time-resolved optical experiments. The genetically modified RC supports transmembrane charge separation from the photoexcited BChl dimer to the primary quinone through the new BChl molecule, but with a reduced quantum yield of 60 percent (compared to 100 percent in wild-type RCs). These results have important implications for the mechanism of charge separation in the RC, and rationalize the choice of (bacterio)pheophytins as electron acceptors in a variety of photosynthetic systems.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Mustached bats orient and find insects by emitting ultrasonic pulses and analyzing the returning echoes. Neurons in the Doppler-shifted constant-frequency (DSCF) and frequency-modulated (FM-FM) areas of the auditory cortex form maps of echo frequency (target velocity) and echo delay (target range), respectively. Bats were trained to discriminate changes in echo frequency or delay, and then these areas were selectively inactivated with muscimol. Inactivation of the DSCF area disrupted frequency but not delay discriminations; inactivation of the FM-FM area disrupted delay but not frequency discriminations. Thus, focal inactivation of specific cortical maps produces specific disruptions in the perception of biosonar signals.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Pathogen recognition by T cells is dependent on their exquisite specificity for self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules presenting a bound peptide. Although this specificity results from positive and negative selection of developing T cells in the thymus, the relative contribution of these two processes remains controversial. To address the relation between the selecting peptide-MHC complex and the specificity of mature T cells, we generated transgenic mice that express a single peptide-MHC class I complex. We demonstrate that positive selection of CD8 T cells in these mice results in an MHC-specific repertoire. Although selection on a single complex is peptide promiscuous, mature T cells are highly peptide specific. Thus, positive selection imparts MHC and peptide specificity on the peripheral CD8 T cell repertoire.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Follicular lymphoma, the most common human lymphoma, characteristically has a t(14; 18) interchromosomal translocation. It is typically an indolent disease comprised of small resting B cells, but frequently develops into a high-grade lymphoma. The t(14; 18) translocates the Bcl-2 gene, generating a deregulated Bcl-2-immunoglobulin fusion gene. Bcl-2 is a novel inner mitochondrial membrane protein that extends the survival of certain cells by blocking programmed cell death. To determine the oncogenic potential of the t(14; 18) translocation, we produced transgenic mice bearing a Bcl-2-immunoglobulin minigene that structurally mimicked the t(14; 18). An indolent follicular hyperplasia in these transgenic mice progressed to a malignant diffuse large-cell lymphoma. The long latency, progression from polyclonal to monoclonal disease, and histological conversion, are all suggestive of secondary changes. Half of the immunoblastic high-grade lymphomas had a rearranged c-myc gene. Our transgenic mice provide an animal model for tumour progression in t(14; 18) lymphoma and show that prolonged B-cell life increases tumour incidence.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) may be a critical factor in the temporal differentiation of glial elements in the mammalian central nervous system. We have used in situ hybridization and immunoperoxidase staining to investigate the localization of PDGF A and have observed high levels of PDGF A-chain mRNA and immunoreactive PDGF A in neurons of embryonic and adult mice. PDGF A-chain expression was shown to be developmentally regulated and tissue specific. Every neuronal population examined in the central and peripheral nervous systems expresses PDGF A transcripts. Variable, significantly weaker signals are observed in glial cells. In contrast to known neurotrophic factors, the PDGF A transcripts are widely distributed among neurons. This generalized distribution of PDGF A transcripts, together with the known effects of PDGF on glial cells in vitro, suggests a unique role of neurons in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of glial cells in vivo.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies of human attention have begun to dissect isolable components of this complex higher brain function, including a midline attentional system in a region of the anterior cingulate cortex. The right hemisphere may play a special part in human attention; neglect, an important phenomenon associated with damage to attentional systems, is more severe, extensive and long-lasting after lesions to the right hemisphere. Here we use PET measurements of brain blood flow in healthy subjects to identify changes in regional brain activity during simple visual and somatosensory tasks of sustained attention or vigilance. We find localized increases in blood flow in the prefrontal and superior parietal cortex primarily in the right hemisphere, regardless of the modality or laterality of sensory input. The anterior cingulate was not activated during either task. These data localize the vigilance aspects of normal human attention to sensory stimuli, thereby clarifying the biology underlying asymmetries of attention to such stimuli that have been reported in clinical lesions.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Alzheimer's disease affects millions of people around the world. Currently, there are no treatments that prevent or slow the disease. Like other neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by protein misfolding in the brain. This process and the associated brain damage begin years before the substantial neurodegeneration that accompanies dementia. Studies using new neuroimaging techniques and fluid biomarkers suggest that Alzheimer's disease pathology can be detected preclinically. These advances should allow the design of new clinical trials and early mechanism-based therapeutic intervention.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain extracellular space is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The factors regulating this process are only partly understood. Abeta aggregation is a concentration-dependent process that is likely responsive to changes in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) levels of Abeta. Using in vivo microdialysis in mice, we found that the amount of ISF Abeta correlated with wakefulness. The amount of ISF Abeta also significantly increased during acute sleep deprivation and during orexin infusion, but decreased with infusion of a dual orexin receptor antagonist. Chronic sleep restriction significantly increased, and a dual orexin receptor antagonist decreased, Abeta plaque formation in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. Thus, the sleep-wake cycle and orexin may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) appears to inhibit tissue factor (TF)-induced blood coagulation by forming a quaternary inhibitory complex containing factor Xa, LACI, factor VIIa, and TF. A genetically engineered hybrid protein consisting of the light chain of factor Xa and the first Kunitz-type inhibitor domain of LACI is shown to directly inhibit the activity of the factor VIIa-TF catalytic complex. Unlike inhibition of factor VIIa-TF activity by native LACI, inhibition by the hybrid protein is not dependent on factor Xa. In an assay of TF-induced coagulation, 50% TF inhibition occurs with hybrid protein at 35 nanograms per milliliter, whereas LACI at 2.5 micrograms per milliliter is required for an equivalent effect. gamma-Carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in the factor Xa light chain portion of the hybrid protein is required for inhibitory activity, indicating that the first Kunitz-type domain of LACI alone is not sufficient for inhibition of factor VIIa-TF.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Activity is thought to guide the patterning of synaptic connections in the developing nervous system. Specifically, differences in the activity of converging inputs are thought to cause the elimination of synapses from less active inputs and increase connectivity with more active inputs. Here we present findings that challenge the generality of this notion and offer a new view of the role of activity in synapse development. To imbalance neurotransmission from different sets of inputs in vivo, we generated transgenic mice in which ON but not OFF types of bipolar cells in the retina express tetanus toxin (TeNT). During development, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) select between ON and OFF bipolar cell inputs (ON or OFF RGCs) or establish a similar number of synapses with both on separate dendritic arborizations (ON-OFF RGCs). In TeNT retinas, ON RGCs correctly selected the silenced ON bipolar cell inputs over the transmitting OFF bipolar cells, but were connected with them through fewer synapses at maturity. Time-lapse imaging revealed that this was caused by a reduced rate of synapse formation rather than an increase in synapse elimination. Similarly, TeNT-expressing ON bipolar cell axons generated fewer presynaptic active zones. The remaining active zones often recruited multiple, instead of single, synaptic ribbons. ON-OFF RGCs in TeNT mice maintained convergence of ON and OFF bipolar cells inputs and had fewer synapses on their ON arbor without changes to OFF arbor synapses. Our results reveal an unexpected and remarkably selective role for activity in circuit development in vivo, regulating synapse formation but not elimination, affecting synapse number but not dendritic or axonal patterning, and mediating independently the refinement of connections from parallel (ON and OFF) processing streams even where they converge onto the same postsynaptic cell.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Itch and pain are two distinct sensations. Although our previous study suggested that gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is an itch-specific gene in the spinal cord, a long-standing question of whether there are separate neuronal pathways for itch and pain remains unsettled. We selectively ablated lamina I neurons expressing GRPR in the spinal cord of mice. These mice showed profound scratching deficits in response to all of the itching (pruritogenic) stimuli tested, irrespective of their histamine dependence. In contrast, pain behaviors were unaffected. Our data also suggest that GRPR+ neurons are different from the spinothalamic tract neurons that have been the focus of the debate. Together, the present study suggests that GRPR+ neurons constitute a long-sought labeled line for itch sensation in the spinal cord.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The nuclear receptor PPARalpha is activated by drugs to treat human disorders of lipid metabolism. Its endogenous ligand is unknown. PPARalpha-dependent gene expression is impaired with inactivation of fatty acid synthase (FAS), suggesting that FAS is involved in generation of a PPARalpha ligand. Here we demonstrate the FAS-dependent presence of a phospholipid bound to PPARalpha isolated from mouse liver. Binding was increased under conditions that induce FAS activity and displaced by systemic injection of a PPARalpha agonist. Mass spectrometry identified the species as 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (16:0/18:1-GPC). Knockdown of Cept1, required for phosphatidylcholine synthesis, suppressed PPARalpha-dependent gene expression. Interaction of 16:0/18:1-GPC with the PPARalpha ligand-binding domain and coactivator peptide motifs was comparable to PPARalpha agonists, but interactions with PPARdelta were weak and none were detected with PPARgamma. Portal vein infusion of 16:0/18:1-GPC induced PPARalpha-dependent gene expression and decreased hepatic steatosis. These data suggest that 16:0/18:1-GPC is a physiologically relevant endogenous PPARalpha ligand.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Related organisms typically respond to a given cue by altering the level or activity of orthologous transcription factors, which, paradoxically, often regulate expression of distinct gene sets. Although promoter rewiring of shared genes is primarily responsible for regulatory differences among related eukaryotic species, in bacteria, species-specific genes are often controlled by ancestral transcription factors, and regulatory circuit evolution has been further shaped by horizontal gene transfer. Modifications in transcription factors and in promoter structure also contribute to divergence in bacterial regulatory circuits.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Viruses that cause chronic infection constitute a stable but little-recognized part of our metagenome: our virome. Ongoing immune responses hold these chronic viruses at bay while avoiding immunopathologic damage to persistently infected tissues. The immunologic imprint generated by these responses to our virome defines the normal immune system. The resulting dynamic but metastable equilibrium between the virome and the host can be dangerous, benign, or even symbiotic. These concepts require that we reformulate how we assign etiologies for diseases, especially those with a chronic inflammatory component, as well as how we design and interpret genome-wide association studies, and how we vaccinate to limit or control our virome.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Activator protein 1 (AP-1, also known as JUN) transcription factors are dimers of JUN, FOS, MAF and activating transcription factor (ATF) family proteins characterized by basic region and leucine zipper domains. Many AP-1 proteins contain defined transcriptional activation domains, but BATF and the closely related BATF3 (refs 2, 3) contain only a basic region and leucine zipper, and are considered to be inhibitors of AP-1 activity. Here we show that Batf is required for the differentiation of IL17-producing T helper (T(H)17) cells. T(H)17 cells comprise a CD4(+) T-cell subset that coordinates inflammatory responses in host defence but is pathogenic in autoimmunity. Batf(-/-) mice have normal T(H)1 and T(H)2 differentiation, but show a defect in T(H)17 differentiation, and are resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Batf(-/-) T cells fail to induce known factors required for T(H)17 differentiation, such as RORgamma t (encoded by Rorc) and the cytokine IL21 (refs 14-17). Neither the addition of IL21 nor the overexpression of RORgamma t fully restores IL17 production in Batf(-/-) T cells. The Il17 promoter is BATF-responsive, and after T(H)17 differentiation, BATF binds conserved intergenic elements in the Il17a-Il17f locus and to the Il17, Il21 and Il22 (ref. 18) promoters. These results demonstrate that the AP-1 protein BATF has a critical role in T(H)17 differentiation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The process of wound repair in epithelium-lined organs of mammals is complex and is influenced by numerous secreted factors including cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines. However, the cellular organizers of this process are still not understood. Recent studies of tissue regeneration in organisms with simpler development have uncovered details about the activity of stem cells in the mesenchyme (the blastema) during this process. These blastemal cells are well positioned to interpret cues from the environment and to execute decisions about the direction of wound repair. In mammalian wounds, stromal stem cells appear to be positioned to perform functions similar to those of blastemal cells, including communication with both the overlying epithelium and the inflammatory cells in the mesenchyme.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare pediatric lung tumor that is often part of an inherited cancer syndrome. PPBs consist of mesenchymal cells that are susceptible to malignant transformation and cysts lined by epithelial cells. In a subset of patients, overgrowth of the cysts by mesenchymal cells leads to sarcoma formation. Here, we show that 11 multiplex PPB families harbor heterozygous germline mutations in DICER1, a gene encoding an endoribonuclease critical to the generation of small noncoding regulatory RNAs. Expression of DICER1 protein was undetectable in the epithelial component of PPB tumors but was retained in the malignant mesenchyme (sarcoma). We hypothesize that loss of DICER1 in the epithelium of the developing lung alters the regulation of diffusible factors that promote mesenchymal proliferation.</p>

We synthesized Pd-Pt bimetallic nanodendrites consisting of a dense array of Pt branches on a Pd core by reducing K2PtCl4 with L-ascorbic acid in the presence of uniform Pd nanocrystal seeds in an aqueous solution. The Pt branches supported on faceted Pd nanocrystals exhibited relatively large surface areas and particularly active facets toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the rate-determining step in a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell. The Pd-Pt nanodendrites were two and a half times more active on the basis of equivalent Pt mass for the ORR than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst and five times more active than the first-generation supportless Pt-black catalyst.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Notch signaling regulates many aspects of metazoan development and tissue renewal. Accordingly, the misregulation or loss of Notch signaling underlies a wide range of human disorders, from developmental syndromes to adult-onset diseases and cancer. Notch signaling is remarkably robust in most tissues even though each Notch molecule is irreversibly activated by proteolysis and signals only once without amplification by secondary messenger cascades. In this Review, we highlight recent studies in Notch signaling that reveal new molecular details about the regulation of ligand-mediated receptor activation, receptor proteolysis, and target selection.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Genetic exchange has not been shown to be a mechanism underlying the extensive diversity of Leishmania parasites. We report here evidence that the invertebrate stages of Leishmania are capable of having a sexual cycle consistent with a meiotic process like that described for African trypanosomes. Hybrid progeny were generated that bore full genomic complements from both parents, but kinetoplast DNA maxicircles from one parent. Mating occurred only in the sand fly vector, and hybrids were transmitted to the mammalian host by sand fly bite. Genetic exchange likely contributes to phenotypic diversity in natural populations, and analysis of hybrid progeny will be useful for positional cloning of the genes controlling traits such as virulence, tissue tropism, and drug resistance.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Sleep is important for memory consolidation and is responsive to waking experience. Clock circuitry is uniquely positioned to coordinate interactions between processes underlying memory and sleep need. Flies increase sleep both after exposure to an enriched social environment and after protocols that induce long-term memory. We found that flies mutant for rutabaga, period, and blistered were deficient for experience-dependent increases in sleep. Rescue of each of these genes within the ventral lateral neurons (LNVs) restores increased sleep after social enrichment. Social experiences that induce increased sleep were associated with an increase in the number of synaptic terminals in the LNV projections into the medulla. The number of synaptic terminals was reduced during sleep and this decline was prevented by sleep deprivation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The conference brought together epithelial cell biologists and molecular microbiologists and emphasized that these seemingly diverse disciplines are intricately intertwined. The model systems discussed throughout the meeting emphasized the novel approaches available to address key issues and begin to understand the molecular details of responses triggered at the microbial-epithelial interface. For example, co-crystallization of native ligand-receptor complexes as well as biologically or chemically altered forms of these complexes will allow fine details of receptor-ligand interactions to be determined. This approach is critical in development of new generation antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, transfection techniques that allow receptor expression in model epithelia, development of representative animal model systems, and development of transgenic mouse strains will aid in dissecting microbial-epithelial interactions and will provide further advances in studies on pathogenesis and tissue and host tropism. We are only beginning to uncover the nature of the bidirectional regulatory signals that occur between microbes and hosts. We know little about how these signals relate to the disease state, to microbial virulence, or to immune function. Clearly the cross talk between cell biologists and microbiologists is an important step in unraveling the events occurring between microbes and eukaryotic cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Modern life-sustaining therapy often succeeds in postponing death but may be ineffective at restoring health. Decisions that influence the time and circumstances of an individual's death are now common and require an accurate and comprehensive characterization of likely outcome. Evaluation of alternative outcomes requires acknowledgement that most patients find some outcomes to be worse than death. Improved understanding of major predictors of patient outcome, combined with rapidly expanding technical abilities to collect and manipulate large amounts of detailed clinical data, have created a new intellectual and technical basis for estimating outcomes from intensive medical care. Such objective probability estimates, such as the system described here, can reduce uncertainty about difficult clinical decisions and can be used by physicians, patients, and society to reorient health care toward more scientifically and ethically defensible approaches.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>An in vivo selection system for isolating targets of DNA binding proteins in yeast was developed and used to identify the DNA binding site for the NGFI-B protein, a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. The feasibility of the technique was verified by selecting DNA fragments that contained binding sites for GCN4, a well-characterized yeast transcriptional activator. The DNA binding domain of NGFI-B, expressed as part of a LexA-NGFI-B-GAL4 chimeric activator, was then used to isolate a rat genomic DNA fragment that contained an NGFI-B binding site. The NGFI-B response element (NBRE) is similar to but functionally distinct from elements recognized by the estrogen and thyroid hormone receptors and the hormone receptor-like proteins COUP-TF, CF1, and H-2RIIBP. Cotransfection experiments in mammalian cells demonstrated that NGFI-B can activate transcription from the NBRE with or without its putative ligand binding domain.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Hypoxia is important in a wide range of biological processes, such as animal hibernation and cell survival, and is particularly relevant in many diseases. The sensitivity of cells and organisms to hypoxic injury varies widely, but the molecular basis for this variation is incompletely understood. Using forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans, we isolated a hypoxia-resistant reduction-of-function mutant of rrt-1 that encodes an arginyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase, an enzyme essential for protein translation. Knockdown of rrt-1, and of most other genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, rescued animals from hypoxia-induced death, and the level of hypoxia resistance was inversely correlated with translation rate. The unfolded protein response was induced by hypoxia and was required for the hypoxia resistance of the reduction-of-function mutant of rrt-1. Thus, translational suppression produces hypoxia resistance, in part by reducing unfolded protein toxicity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Our understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity is limited by the paucity of examples in which multiple, interacting loci have been identified. We show that natural variation in the efficiency of sporulation, the program in yeast that initiates the sexual phase of the life cycle, between oak tree and vineyard strains is due to allelic variation between four nucleotide changes in three transcription factors: IME1, RME1, and RSF1. Furthermore, we identified that selection has shaped quantitative variation in yeast sporulation between strains. These results illustrate how genetic interactions between transcription factors are a major source of phenotypic diversity within species.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The capacity of cells to organize and contract collagen fibrils is fundamental to processes as diverse as embryogenesis and wound healing. We analyzed different beta 1 integrins on diploid fibroblasts for their role in modifying the tertiary structure of collagen matrices. Using monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction of integrins with their ligands, evidence was obtained that alpha 2 beta 1 integrin is required for the contraction of a type I collagen matrix. Further supporting the role of alpha 2 beta 1, cell lines expressing minimal levels of this integrin uniformly failed to contract collagen matrices. In addition, transfection of a full-length alpha 2 cDNA into one such cell line led to enhanced cell surface expression of alpha 2 beta 1 and conferred the de novo capacity to contract collagen matrices.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The number of lymphocytes in an animal is remarkably constant despite antigen-driven proliferation and a high rate of B-cell lymphopoiesis. This reflects the relatively brief lifespan of many newly generated B cells and argues for a well-regulated death mechanism. Even so, a secondary immune response can be generated years after a primary exposure to antigen. Antigen that might restimulate B cells persists for extended periods on follicular dendritic cells in the light zone of germinal centres. Antigen-binding B cells have also been found months after the end of obvious cell division. The precise signal that enables certain B cells to emerge as long-term surviving memory cells is unknown. Bcl-2, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, blocks programmed cell death in B cells. We report here that this proto-oncogene maintains immune responsiveness. Transgenic mice overproducing Bcl-2 have a long-term persistence of immunoglobulin-secreting cells and an extended lifetime for memory B cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The human distal gut harbours a vast ensemble of microbes (the microbiota) that provide important metabolic capabilities, including the ability to extract energy from otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides. Studies of a few unrelated, healthy adults have revealed substantial diversity in their gut communities, as measured by sequencing 16S rRNA genes, yet how this diversity relates to function and to the rest of the genes in the collective genomes of the microbiota (the gut microbiome) remains obscure. Studies of lean and obese mice suggest that the gut microbiota affects energy balance by influencing the efficiency of calorie harvest from the diet, and how this harvested energy is used and stored. Here we characterize the faecal microbial communities of adult female monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs concordant for leanness or obesity, and their mothers, to address how host genotype, environmental exposure and host adiposity influence the gut microbiome. Analysis of 154 individuals yielded 9,920 near full-length and 1,937,461 partial bacterial 16S rRNA sequences, plus 2.14 gigabases from their microbiomes. The results reveal that the human gut microbiome is shared among family members, but that each person's gut microbial community varies in the specific bacterial lineages present, with a comparable degree of co-variation between adult monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs. However, there was a wide array of shared microbial genes among sampled individuals, comprising an extensive, identifiable 'core microbiome' at the gene, rather than at the organismal lineage, level. Obesity is associated with phylum-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial diversity and altered representation of bacterial genes and metabolic pathways. These results demonstrate that a diversity of organismal assemblages can nonetheless yield a core microbiome at a functional level, and that deviations from this core are associated with different physiological states (obese compared with lean).</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Tissue macrophages comprise a heterogeneous group of cell types differing in location, surface markers and function. Red pulp macrophages are a distinct splenic subset involved in removing senescent red blood cells. Transcription factors such as PU.1 (also known as Sfpi1) and C/EBPalpha (Cebpa) have general roles in myelomonocytic development, but the transcriptional basis for producing tissue macrophage subsets remains unknown. Here we show that Spi-C (encoded by Spic), a PU.1-related transcription factor, selectively controls the development of red pulp macrophages. Spi-C is highly expressed in red pulp macrophages, but not monocytes, dendritic cells or other tissue macrophages. Spic(-/-) mice have a cell-autonomous defect in the development of red pulp macrophages that is corrected by retroviral Spi-C expression in bone marrow cells, but have normal monocyte and other macrophage subsets. Red pulp macrophages highly express genes involved in capturing circulating haemoglobin and in iron regulation. Spic(-/-) mice show normal trapping of red blood cells in the spleen, but fail to phagocytose these red blood cells efficiently, and develop an iron overload localized selectively to splenic red pulp. Thus, Spi-C controls development of red pulp macrophages required for red blood cell recycling and iron homeostasis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Transcription factor binding sites are being discovered at a rapid pace. It is now necessary to turn attention towards understanding how these sites work in combination to influence gene expression. Quantitative models that accurately predict gene expression from promoter sequence will be a crucial part of solving this problem. Here we present such a model, based on the analysis of synthetic promoter libraries in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Thermodynamic models based only on the equilibrium binding of transcription factors to DNA and to each other captured a large fraction of the variation in expression in every library. Thermodynamic analysis of these libraries uncovered several phenomena in our system, including cooperativity and the effects of weak binding sites. When applied to the S. cerevisiae genome, a model of repression by Mig1 (which was trained on synthetic promoters) predicts a number of Mig1-regulated genes that lack significant Mig1-binding sites in their promoters. The success of the thermodynamic approach suggests that the information encoded by combinations of cis-regulatory sites is interpreted primarily through simple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, with complicated biochemical reactions-such as nucleosome modifications-being downstream events. Quantitative analyses of synthetic promoter libraries will be an important tool in unravelling the rules underlying combinatorial cis-regulation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Nuclear transcription is not restricted to genes but occurs throughout the intergenic and noncoding space of eukaryotic genomes. The functional significance of this widespread noncoding transcription is mostly unknown. We show that Arabidopsis RNA polymerase IVb/Pol V, a multisubunit nuclear enzyme required for siRNA-mediated gene silencing of transposons and other repeats, transcribes intergenic and noncoding sequences, thereby facilitating heterochromatin formation and silencing of overlapping and adjacent genes. Pol IVb/Pol V transcription requires the chromatin-remodeling protein DRD1 but is independent of siRNA biogenesis. However, Pol IVb/Pol V transcription and siRNA production are both required to silence transposons, suggesting that Pol IVb/Pol V generates RNAs or chromatin structures that serve as scaffolds for siRNA-mediated heterochromatin-forming complexes. Pol IVb/Pol V function provides a solution to a paradox of epigenetic control: the need for transcription in order to transcriptionally silence the same region.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although in vitro observations suggest that cross-presentation of antigens is mediated primarily by CD8alpha+ dendritic cells, in vivo analysis has been hampered by the lack of systems that selectively eliminate this cell lineage. We show that deletion of the transcription factor Batf3 ablated development of CD8alpha+ dendritic cells, allowing us to examine their role in immunity in vivo. Dendritic cells from Batf3-/- mice were defective in cross-presentation, and Batf3-/- mice lacked virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses to West Nile virus. Importantly, rejection of highly immunogenic syngeneic tumors was impaired in Batf3-/- mice. These results suggest an important role for CD8alpha+ dendritic cells and cross-presentation in responses to viruses and in tumor rejection.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Antigen processing requires intracellular antigen catabolism to generate immunogenic peptides that bind to class II MHC molecules (MHC-II) for presentation to T-cells. We now provide direct evidence that these peptides are produced within dense lysosomes, as opposed to earlier endocytic compartments. The protein antigen hen egg lysozyme was targeted to endosomes or lysosomes by encapsulating it in liposomes of different membrane composition. Acid-sensitive liposomes released their contents in early endosomes, whereas acid-resistant liposomes sequestered their contents from potential endosomal processing events and released their contents only after delivery to lysosomes. Antigen encapsulated in acid-resistant liposomes was processed in a chloroquine-sensitive manner and presented more efficiently than soluble antigen or antigen encapsulated in acid-sensitive liposomes. Thus, peptides may be recycled from lysosomes, transported to endosomes to bind MHC-II, and then expressed at the cell surface.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Acute myeloid leukaemia is a highly malignant haematopoietic tumour that affects about 13,000 adults in the United States each year. The treatment of this disease has changed little in the past two decades, because most of the genetic events that initiate the disease remain undiscovered. Whole-genome sequencing is now possible at a reasonable cost and timeframe to use this approach for the unbiased discovery of tumour-specific somatic mutations that alter the protein-coding genes. Here we present the results obtained from sequencing a typical acute myeloid leukaemia genome, and its matched normal counterpart obtained from the same patient's skin. We discovered ten genes with acquired mutations; two were previously described mutations that are thought to contribute to tumour progression, and eight were new mutations present in virtually all tumour cells at presentation and relapse, the function of which is not yet known. Our study establishes whole-genome sequencing as an unbiased method for discovering cancer-initiating mutations in previously unidentified genes that may respond to targeted therapies.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Natural killer (NK) cells are classically viewed as lymphocytes that provide innate surveillance against virally infected cells and tumour cells through the release of cytolytic mediators and interferon (IFN)-gamma. In humans, blood CD56(dim) NK cells specialize in the lysis of cell targets. In the lymph nodes, CD56(bright) NK cells secrete IFN-gamma cooperating with dendritic cells and T cells in the generation of adaptive responses. Here we report the characterization of a human NK cell subset located in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues, such as tonsils and Peyer's patches, which is hard-wired to secrete interleukin (IL)-22, IL-26 and leukaemia inhibitory factor. These NK cells, which we refer to as NK-22 cells, are triggered by acute exposure to IL-23. In vitro, NK-22-secreted cytokines stimulate epithelial cells to secrete IL-10, proliferate and express a variety of mitogenic and anti-apoptotic molecules. NK-22 cells are also found in mouse mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and appear in the small intestine lamina propria during bacterial infection, suggesting that NK-22 cells provide an innate source of IL-22 that may help constrain inflammation and protect mucosal sites.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Determining the genetic basis of cancer requires comprehensive analyses of large collections of histopathologically well-classified primary tumours. Here we report the results of a collaborative study to discover somatic mutations in 188 human lung adenocarcinomas. DNA sequencing of 623 genes with known or potential relationships to cancer revealed more than 1,000 somatic mutations across the samples. Our analysis identified 26 genes that are mutated at significantly high frequencies and thus are probably involved in carcinogenesis. The frequently mutated genes include tyrosine kinases, among them the EGFR homologue ERBB4; multiple ephrin receptor genes, notably EPHA3; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR; and NTRK genes. These data provide evidence of somatic mutations in primary lung adenocarcinoma for several tumour suppressor genes involved in other cancers--including NF1, APC, RB1 and ATM--and for sequence changes in PTPRD as well as the frequently deleted gene LRP1B. The observed mutational profiles correlate with clinical features, smoking status and DNA repair defects. These results are reinforced by data integration including single nucleotide polymorphism array and gene expression array. Our findings shed further light on several important signalling pathways involved in lung adenocarcinoma, and suggest new molecular targets for treatment.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>DNA double-strand breaks are generated by genotoxic agents and by cellular endonucleases as intermediates of several important physiological processes. The cellular response to genotoxic DNA breaks includes the activation of transcriptional programs known primarily to regulate cell-cycle checkpoints and cell survival. DNA double-strand breaks are generated in all developing lymphocytes during the assembly of antigen receptor genes, a process that is essential for normal lymphocyte development. Here we show that in murine lymphocytes these physiological DNA breaks activate a broad transcriptional program. This program transcends the canonical DNA double-strand break response and includes many genes that regulate diverse cellular processes important for lymphocyte development. Moreover, the expression of several of these genes is regulated similarly in response to genotoxic DNA damage. Thus, physiological DNA double-strand breaks provide cues that can regulate cell-type-specific processes not directly involved in maintaining the integrity of the genome, and genotoxic DNA breaks could disrupt normal cellular functions by corrupting these processes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Susceptibility to Crohn's disease, a complex inflammatory disease involving the small intestine, is controlled by over 30 loci. One Crohn's disease risk allele is in ATG16L1, a gene homologous to the essential yeast autophagy gene ATG16 (ref. 2). It is not known how ATG16L1 or autophagy contributes to intestinal biology or Crohn's disease pathogenesis. To address these questions, we generated and characterized mice that are hypomorphic for ATG16L1 protein expression, and validated conclusions on the basis of studies in these mice by analysing intestinal tissues that we collected from Crohn's disease patients carrying the Crohn's disease risk allele of ATG16L1. Here we show that ATG16L1 is a bona fide autophagy protein. Within the ileal epithelium, both ATG16L1 and a second essential autophagy protein ATG5 are selectively important for the biology of the Paneth cell, a specialized epithelial cell that functions in part by secretion of granule contents containing antimicrobial peptides and other proteins that alter the intestinal environment. ATG16L1- and ATG5-deficient Paneth cells exhibited notable abnormalities in the granule exocytosis pathway. In addition, transcriptional analysis revealed an unexpected gain of function specific to ATG16L1-deficient Paneth cells including increased expression of genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling and lipid metabolism, of acute phase reactants and of two adipocytokines, leptin and adiponectin, known to directly influence intestinal injury responses. Importantly, Crohn's disease patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 Crohn's disease risk allele displayed Paneth cell granule abnormalities similar to those observed in autophagy-protein-deficient mice and expressed increased levels of leptin protein. Thus, ATG16L1, and probably the process of autophagy, have a role within the intestinal epithelium of mice and Crohn's disease patients by selective effects on the cell biology and specialized regulatory properties of Paneth cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plays a central pathophysiological role in Alzheimer's disease, but little is known about the concentration and dynamics of this secreted peptide in the extracellular space of the human brain. We used intracerebral microdialysis to obtain serial brain interstitial fluid (ISF) samples in 18 patients who were undergoing invasive intracranial monitoring after acute brain injury. We found a strong positive correlation between changes in brain ISF Abeta concentrations and neurological status, with Abeta concentrations increasing as neurological status improved and falling when neurological status declined. Brain ISF Abeta concentrations were also lower when other cerebral physiological and metabolic abnormalities reflected depressed neuronal function. Such dynamics fit well with the hypothesis that neuronal activity regulates extracellular Abeta concentration.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The kinetics of transcription by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase relate directly to the regulation of transcription and to the properties of processive enzymes in general, but analysis of RNA polymerase movement along the DNA template has so far been limited to the study of populations of enzyme molecules. The ability to view nanometre-sized particles with the light microscope suggested a method of monitoring transcription by individual RNA polymerase molecules. We describe here the behaviour of 40-nm-diameter particles of colloidal gold attached to the ends of DNA molecules being transcribed by RNA polymerase immobilized on a glass surface. The tethered gold particles are released from the surface at times after addition of nucleoside triphosphates that are consistent with the kinetics of transcription by RNA polymerase in solution. Analysis of the brownian motion of the gold particles enabled us to measure the movement along the template DNA of individual polymerase molecules.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Long-period seismic sources associated with glacier motion have been recently discovered, and an increase in ice flow over the past decade has been suggested on the basis of secular changes in such measurements. Their significance, however, remains uncertain, as a relationship to ice flow has not been confirmed by direct observation. Here we combine long-period surface-wave observations with simultaneous Global Positioning System measurements of ice displacement to study the tidally modulated stick-slip motion of the Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica. The seismic origin time corresponds to slip nucleation at a region of the bed of the Whillans Ice Stream that is likely stronger than in surrounding regions and, thus, acts like an 'asperity' in traditional fault models. In addition to the initial pulse, two seismic arrivals occurring 10-23 minutes later represent stopping phases as the slip terminates at the ice stream edge and the grounding line. Seismic amplitude and average rupture velocity are correlated with tidal amplitude for the different slip events during the spring-to-neap tidal cycle. Although the total seismic moment calculated from ice rigidity, slip displacement, and rupture area is equivalent to an earthquake of moment magnitude seven (M(w) 7), seismic amplitudes are modest (M(s) 3.6-4.2), owing to the source duration of 20-30 minutes. Seismic radiation from ice movement is proportional to the derivative of the moment rate function at periods of 25-100 seconds and very long-period radiation is not detected, owing to the source geometry. Long-period seismic waves are thus useful for detecting and studying sudden ice movements but are insensitive to the total amount of slip.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Developmental mechanisms that yield multicellular diversity are proving to be well conserved within lineages, generating interest in their origins in unicellular ancestors. We report that molecular regulation of the haploid-diploid transition in Chlamydomonas, a unicellular green soil alga, shares common ancestry with differentiation pathways in land plants. Two homeoproteins, Gsp1 and Gsm1, contributed by gametes of plus and minus mating types respectively, physically interact and translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus upon gametic fusion, initiating zygote development. Their ectopic expression activates zygote development in vegetative cells and, in a diploid background, the resulting zygotes undergo a normal meiosis. Gsm1/Gsp1 dyads share sequence homology with and are functionally related to KNOX/BELL dyads regulating stem-cell (meristem) specification in land plants. We propose that combinatorial homeoprotein-based transcriptional control, a core feature of the fungal/animal radiation, may have originated in a sexual context and enabled the evolution of land-plant body plans.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The oceans harbor a tremendous diversity of marine microbes. Different functional groups of bacteria, archaea, and protists arise from this diversity to dominate various habitats and drive globally important biogeochemical cycles. Explanations for the distribution of microbial taxa and their associated activity often focus on resource availability and abiotic conditions. However, the continual reshaping of communities by mortality, allelopathy, symbiosis, and other processes shows that community interactions exert strong selective pressure on marine microbes. Deeper exploration of microbial interactions is now possible via molecular prospecting and taxon-specific experimental approaches. A holistic outlook that encompasses the full array of selective pressures on individuals will help elucidate the maintenance of microbial diversity and the regulation of biogeochemical reactions by planktonic communities.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Mammals are metagenomic in that they are composed of not only their own gene complements but also those of all of their associated microbes. To understand the coevolution of the mammals and their indigenous microbial communities, we conducted a network-based analysis of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences from the fecal microbiota of humans and 59 other mammalian species living in two zoos and in the wild. The results indicate that host diet and phylogeny both influence bacterial diversity, which increases from carnivory to omnivory to herbivory; that bacterial communities codiversified with their hosts; and that the gut microbiota of humans living a modern life-style is typical of omnivorous primates.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We present a draft genome sequence of the platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus. This monotreme exhibits a fascinating combination of reptilian and mammalian characters. For example, platypuses have a coat of fur adapted to an aquatic lifestyle; platypus females lactate, yet lay eggs; and males are equipped with venom similar to that of reptiles. Analysis of the first monotreme genome aligned these features with genetic innovations. We find that reptile and platypus venom proteins have been co-opted independently from the same gene families; milk protein genes are conserved despite platypuses laying eggs; and immune gene family expansions are directly related to platypus biology. Expansions of protein, non-protein-coding RNA and microRNA families, as well as repeat elements, are identified. Sequencing of this genome now provides a valuable resource for deep mammalian comparative analyses, as well as for monotreme biology and conservation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Canonical Wnt signaling critically regulates cell fate and proliferation in development and disease. Nuclear localization of beta-catenin is indispensable for canonical Wnt signaling; however, the mechanisms governing beta-catenin nuclear localization are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in response to Wnt requires Rac1 activation. The role of Rac1 depends on phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Ser191 and Ser605, which is mediated by JNK2 kinase. Mutations of these residues significantly affect Wnt-induced beta-catenin nuclear accumulation. Genetic ablation of Rac1 in the mouse embryonic limb bud ectoderm disrupts canonical Wnt signaling and phenocopies deletion of beta-catenin in causing severe truncations of the limb. Finally, Rac1 interacts genetically with beta-catenin and Dkk1 in controlling limb outgrowth. Together these results uncover Rac1 activation and subsequent beta-catenin phosphorylation as a hitherto uncharacterized mechanism controlling canonical Wnt signaling and may provide additional targets for therapeutic intervention of this important pathway.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor, including phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, protect against brain damage in neurological disorders such as stroke. However, these agents have psychotomimetic properties in humans and morphologically damage neurons in the cerebral cortex of rats. It is now shown that the morphological damage can be prevented by certain anticholinergic drugs or by diazepam and barbiturates, which act at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-channel complex and are known to suppress the psychotomimetic symptoms caused by ketamine. Thus, it may be possible to prevent the unwanted side effects of NMDA antagonists, thereby enhancing their utility as neuroprotective drugs.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The vast majority of cortical thymocytes die during T cell development while those that survive this selective process accumulate in the medulla. bcl-2, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in certain cell lines. In the thymus, bcl-2 is regionally localized to the mature T cells of the medulla. To assess the role of bcl-2 in the programmed death of thymocytes, we generated transgenic mice that redirected bcl-2 expression to cortical thymocytes. bcl-2 protected immature CD4+8+ thymocytes from glucocorticoid, radiation, and anti-CD3-induced apoptosis. Moreover, bcl-2 altered T cell maturation, resulting in increased percentages of CD3hi and CD4-8+ thymocytes. Despite this, clonal deletion of T cells that recognize endogenous superantigens still occurred. This transgenic model indicates that multiple death pathways operate within the thymus that can be distinguished by their dependence on bcl-2.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Bipedalism is a key human adaptation and a defining feature of the hominin clade. Fossil femora discovered in Kenya and attributed to Orrorin tugenensis, at 6 million years ago, purportedly provide the earliest postcranial evidence of hominin bipedalism, but their functional and phylogenetic affinities are controversial. We show that the O. tugenensis femur differs from those of apes and Homo and most strongly resembles those of Australopithecus and Paranthropus, indicating that O. tugenensis was bipedal but is not more closely related to Homo than to Australopithecus. Femoral morphology indicates that O. tugenensis shared distinctive hip biomechanics with australopiths, suggesting that this complex evolved early in human evolution and persisted for almost 4 million years until modifications of the hip appeared in the late Pliocene in early Homo.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Perception of depth is a fundamental challenge for the visual system, particularly for observers moving through their environment. The brain makes use of multiple visual cues to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of a scene. One potent cue, motion parallax, frequently arises during translation of the observer because the images of objects at different distances move across the retina with different velocities. Human psychophysical studies have demonstrated that motion parallax can be a powerful depth cue, and motion parallax seems to be heavily exploited by animal species that lack highly developed binocular vision. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie this capacity. Here we show, by using a virtual-reality system to translate macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) while they viewed motion parallax displays that simulated objects at different depths, that many neurons in the middle temporal area (area MT) signal the sign of depth (near versus far) from motion parallax in the absence of other depth cues. To achieve this, neurons must combine visual motion with extra-retinal (non-visual) signals related to the animal's movement. Our findings suggest a new neural substrate for depth perception and demonstrate a robust interaction of visual and non-visual cues in area MT. Combined with previous studies that implicate area MT in depth perception based on binocular disparities, our results suggest that area MT contains a more general representation of three-dimensional space that makes use of multiple cues.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In the presence of antigen presenting cells, a murine T helper (Th) cell specific for murine hemoglobin (Hb) responded to its immunogenic peptide by both cytokine (interleukin-4) secretion and proliferation. An altered Hb peptide with a single amino acid substitution induced only cytokine secretion and did not induce proliferation. Interleukin-1 costimulated and restored the Th proliferative response to normal levels. The altered peptide also supported cognate T cell-B cell interactions indicative of T cell helper function. Thus, this result suggests that the T cell receptor has the capacity of differential signaling.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Calcium controls a number of critical events, including motility, secretion, cell invasion and egress by apicomplexan parasites. Compared to animal and plant cells, the molecular mechanisms that govern calcium signalling in parasites are poorly understood. Here we show that the production of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) controls calcium signalling within the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, an opportunistic human pathogen. In plants, ABA controls a number of important events, including environmental stress responses, embryo development and seed dormancy. ABA induces production of the second-messenger cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), which controls release of intracellular calcium stores in plants. cADPR also controls intracellular calcium release in the protozoan parasite T. gondii; however, previous studies have not revealed the molecular basis of this pathway. We found that addition of exogenous ABA induced formation of cADPR in T. gondii, stimulated calcium-dependent protein secretion, and induced parasite egress from the infected host cell in a density-dependent manner. Production of endogenous ABA within the parasite was confirmed by purification (using high-performance liquid chromatography) and analysis (by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). Selective disruption of ABA synthesis by the inhibitor fluridone delayed egress and induced development of the slow-growing, dormant cyst stage of the parasite. Thus, ABA-mediated calcium signalling controls the decision between lytic and chronic stage growth, a developmental switch that is central in pathogenesis and transmission. The pathway for ABA production was probably acquired with an algal endosymbiont that was retained as a non-photosynthetic plastid known as the apicoplast. The plant-like nature of this pathway may be exploited therapeutically, as shown by the ability of a specific inhibitor of ABA synthesis to prevent toxoplasmosis in the mouse model.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The capacity of immunity to control and shape cancer, that is, cancer immunoediting, is the result of three processes that function either independently or in sequence: elimination (cancer immunosurveillance, in which immunity functions as an extrinsic tumour suppressor in naive hosts); equilibrium (expansion of transformed cells is held in check by immunity); and escape (tumour cell variants with dampened immunogenicity or the capacity to attenuate immune responses grow into clinically apparent cancers). Extensive experimental support now exists for the elimination and escape processes because immunodeficient mice develop more carcinogen-induced and spontaneous cancers than wild-type mice, and tumour cells from immunodeficient mice are more immunogenic than those from immunocompetent mice. In contrast, the equilibrium process was inferred largely from clinical observations, including reports of transplantation of undetected (occult) cancer from organ donor into immunosuppressed recipients. Herein we use a mouse model of primary chemical carcinogenesis and demonstrate that equilibrium occurs, is mechanistically distinguishable from elimination and escape, and that neoplastic cells in equilibrium are transformed but proliferate poorly in vivo. We also show that tumour cells in equilibrium are unedited but become edited when they spontaneously escape immune control and grow into clinically apparent tumours. These results reveal that, in addition to destroying tumour cells and sculpting tumour immunogenicity, the immune system of a naive mouse can also restrain cancer growth for extended time periods.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>To evaluate the isotopic composition of the solar nebula from which the planets formed, the relation between isotopes measured in the solar wind and on the Sun's surface needs to be known. The Genesis Discovery mission returned independent samples of three types of solar wind produced by different solar processes that provide a check on possible isotopic variations, or fractionation, between the solar-wind and solar-surface material. At a high level of precision, we observed no significant inter-regime differences in 20Ne/22Ne or 36Ar/38Ar values. For 20Ne/22Ne, the difference between low- and high-speed wind components is 0.24 +/- 0.37%; for 36Ar/38Ar, it is 0.11 +/- 0.26%. Our measured 36Ar/38Ar ratio in the solar wind of 5.501 +/- 0.005 is 3.42 +/- 0.09% higher than that of the terrestrial atmosphere, which may reflect atmospheric losses early in Earth's history.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Nutrient availability is one of the strongest determinants of cell size. When grown in rich media, single-celled organisms such as yeast and bacteria can be up to twice the size of their slow-growing counterparts. The ability to modulate size in a nutrient-dependent manner requires cells to: (1) detect when they have reached the appropriate mass for a given growth rate and (2) transmit this information to the division apparatus. We report the identification of a metabolic sensor that couples nutritional availability to division in Bacillus subtilis. A key component of this sensor is an effector, UgtP, which localizes to the division site in a nutrient-dependent manner and inhibits assembly of the tubulin-like cell division protein FtsZ. This sensor serves to maintain a constant ratio of FtsZ rings to cell length regardless of growth rate and ensures that cells reach the appropriate mass and complete chromosome segregation prior to cytokinesis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are promising gene therapy vectors that have little or no acute toxicity. We show that normal mice and mice with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after neonatal injection of an AAV vector expressing b-glucuronidase. AAV proviruses were isolated from four tumors and were all located within a 6-kilobase region of chromosome 12. This locus encodes several imprinted transcripts, small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and microRNAs. Transcripts from adjacent genes encoding snoRNAs and microRNAs were overexpressed in tumors. Our findings implicate this locus in the development of HCC and raise concerns over the clinical use of AAV vectors.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Itching, or pruritus, is defined as an unpleasant cutaneous sensation that serves as a physiological self-protective mechanism to prevent the body from being hurt by harmful external agents. Chronic itch represents a significant clinical problem resulting from renal diseases and liver diseases, as well as several serious skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis. The identity of the itch-specific mediator in the central nervous system, however, remains elusive. Here we describe that the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) plays an important part in mediating itch sensation in the dorsal spinal cord. We found that gastrin-releasing peptide is specifically expressed in a small subset of peptidergic dorsal root ganglion neurons, whereas expression of its receptor GRPR is restricted to lamina I of the dorsal spinal cord. GRPR mutant mice showed comparable thermal, mechanical, inflammatory and neuropathic pain responses relative to wild-type mice. In contrast, induction of scratching behaviour was significantly reduced in GRPR mutant mice in response to pruritogenic stimuli, whereas normal responses were evoked by painful stimuli. Moreover, direct spinal cerebrospinal fluid injection of a GRPR antagonist significantly inhibited scratching behaviour in three independent itch models. These data demonstrate that GRPR is required for mediating the itch sensation rather than pain, at the spinal level. Our results thus indicate that GRPR may represent the first molecule that is dedicated to mediating the itch sensation in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and thus may provide a central therapeutic target for antipruritic drug development.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The goal of islet transplantation in human diabetes is to maintain the islet grafts in the recipients without the use of immunosuppression. One approach is to encapsulate the donor islets in permselective membranes. Hollow fibers fabricated from an acrylic copolymer were used to encapsulate small numbers of rat islets that were immobilized in an alginate hydrogel for transplantation in diabetic mice. The fibers were biocompatible, prevented rejection, and maintained normoglycemia when transplanted intraperitoneally; hyperglycemia returned when the fibers were removed at 60 days. Normoglycemia was also maintained by subcutaneous implants that had an appropriately constructed outer surface on the fibers.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>All humans become infected with multiple herpesviruses during childhood. After clearance of acute infection, herpesviruses enter a dormant state known as latency. Latency persists for the life of the host and is presumed to be parasitic, as it leaves the individual at risk for subsequent viral reactivation and disease. Here we show that herpesvirus latency also confers a surprising benefit to the host. Mice latently infected with either murine gammaherpesvirus 68 or murine cytomegalovirus, which are genetically highly similar to the human pathogens Epstein-Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus, respectively, are resistant to infection with the bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis. Latency-induced protection is not antigen specific but involves prolonged production of the antiviral cytokine interferon-gamma and systemic activation of macrophages. Latency thereby upregulates the basal activation state of innate immunity against subsequent infections. We speculate that herpesvirus latency may also sculpt the immune response to self and environmental antigens through establishment of a polarized cytokine environment. Thus, whereas the immune evasion capabilities and lifelong persistence of herpesviruses are commonly viewed as solely pathogenic, our data suggest that latency is a symbiotic relationship with immune benefits for the host.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The traditional approach to studying brain function is to measure physiological responses to controlled sensory, motor and cognitive paradigms. However, most of the brain's energy consumption is devoted to ongoing metabolic activity not clearly associated with any particular stimulus or behaviour. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans aimed at understanding this ongoing activity have shown that spontaneous fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal occur continuously in the resting state. In humans, these fluctuations are temporally coherent within widely distributed cortical systems that recapitulate the functional architecture of responses evoked by experimentally administered tasks. Here, we show that the same phenomenon is present in anaesthetized monkeys even at anaesthetic levels known to induce profound loss of consciousness. We specifically demonstrate coherent spontaneous fluctuations within three well known systems (oculomotor, somatomotor and visual) and the 'default' system, a set of brain regions thought by some to support uniquely human capabilities. Our results indicate that coherent system fluctuations probably reflect an evolutionarily conserved aspect of brain functional organization that transcends levels of consciousness.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The Opportunity Mars Exploration Rover found evidence for groundwater activity in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars in the form of aeolian and fluvial sediments composed of sulphate-rich grains. These sediments appear to have experienced diagenetic modification in the presence of a fluctuating water table. In addition to the extensive secondary aqueous alteration, the primary grains themselves probably derive from earlier playa evaporites. Little is known, however, about the hydrologic processes responsible for this environmental history-particularly how such extensive evaporite deposits formed in the absence of a topographic basin. Here we investigate the origin of these deposits, in the context of the global hydrology of early Mars, using numerical simulations, and demonstrate that Meridiani is one of the few regions of currently exposed ancient crust predicted to have experienced significant groundwater upwelling and evaporation. The global groundwater flow would have been driven primarily by precipitation-induced recharge and evaporative loss, with the formation of the Tharsis volcanic rise possibly playing a role through the burial of aquifers and induced global deformation. These results suggest that the deposits formed as a result of sustained groundwater upwelling and evaporation, rather than ponding within an enclosed basin. The evaporite formation coincided with a transition to more arid conditions that increased the relative impact of a deep-seated, global-scale hydrology on the surface evolution.</p>

We show that the plasminogen activator Pla is essential for Y. pestis to cause primary pneumonic plague but is less important for dissemination during pneumonic plague than during bubonic plague. Experiments manipulating its temporal expression showed that Pla allows Y. pestis to replicate rapidly in the airways, causing a lethal fulminant pneumonia; if unexpressed, inflammation is aborted, and lung repair is activated. Inhibition of Pla expression prolonged the survival of animals with the disease, offering a therapeutic option to extend the period during which antibiotics are effective.</p>

However, this conclusion is based on a limited set of possible equations of state for quark matter. Here we compare Ozel's observational limits with predictions based on a more comprehensive set of proposed quark-matter equations of state from the literature, and conclude that the presence of quark matter in EXO 0748-676 is not ruled out.</p>

In this issue, Ueki et al. (Ueki et al., 2007) now demonstrate that a cherubism mutation activates mouse Sh3bp2 resulting in enhanced production of the cytokine TNF-alpha by myeloid cells, leading to both bone loss and inflammation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The worldwide obesity epidemic is stimulating efforts to identify host and environmental factors that affect energy balance. Comparisons of the distal gut microbiota of genetically obese mice and their lean littermates, as well as those of obese and lean human volunteers have revealed that obesity is associated with changes in the relative abundance of the two dominant bacterial divisions, the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. Here we demonstrate through metagenomic and biochemical analyses that these changes affect the metabolic potential of the mouse gut microbiota. Our results indicate that the obese microbiome has an increased capacity to harvest energy from the diet. Furthermore, this trait is transmissible: colonization of germ-free mice with an 'obese microbiota' results in a significantly greater increase in total body fat than colonization with a 'lean microbiota'. These results identify the gut microbiota as an additional contributing factor to the pathophysiology of obesity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Two groups of beneficial bacteria are dominant in the human gut, the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes. Here we show that the relative proportion of Bacteroidetes is decreased in obese people by comparison with lean people, and that this proportion increases with weight loss on two types of low-calorie diet. Our findings indicate that obesity has a microbial component, which might have potential therapeutic implications.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Toxoplasma gondii strains differ dramatically in virulence despite being genetically very similar. Genetic mapping revealed two closely adjacent quantitative trait loci on parasite chromosome VIIa that control the extreme virulence of the type I lineage. Positional cloning identified the candidate virulence gene ROP18, a highly polymorphic serine-threonine kinase that was secreted into the host cell during parasite invasion. Transfection of the virulent ROP18 allele into a nonpathogenic type III strain increased growth and enhanced mortality by 4 to 5 logs. These attributes of ROP18 required kinase activity, which revealed that secretion of effectors is a major component of parasite virulence.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is a master regulator of Salmonella pathogenicity. Here we report that induction of the PhoP/PhoQ system results in an initial surge of PhoP phosphorylation; the occupancy of target promoters by the PhoP protein; and the transcription of PhoP-activated genes, which then subsides to reach new steady-state levels. This surge in PhoP activity is due to PhoP positively activating its own transcription, because a strain constitutively expressing the PhoP protein attained steady-state levels of activation asymptotically, without the surge. The strain constitutively expressing the PhoP protein was attenuated for virulence in mice, demonstrating that the surge conferred by PhoP's positive feedback loop is necessary to jump-start Salmonella's virulence program.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>As the environment changes, will species be able to adapt? By conducting experiments in natural environments, biologists can study how evolutionary processes such as natural selection operate through time. We predicted that the introduction of a terrestrial predator would first select for longer-legged lizards, which are faster, but as the lizards shifted onto high twigs to avoid the predator, selection would reverse toward favoring the shorter-legged individuals better able to locomote there. Our experimental studies on 12 islets confirmed these predictions within a single generation, thus demonstrating the rapidity with which evolutionary forces can change during times of environmental flux.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The gut microbiotas of zebrafish and mice share six bacterial divisions, although the specific bacteria within these divisions differ. To test how factors specific to host gut habitat shape microbial community structure, we performed reciprocal transplantations of these microbiotas into germ-free zebrafish and mouse recipients. The results reveal that communities are assembled in predictable ways. The transplanted community resembles its community of origin in terms of the lineages present, but the relative abundance of the lineages changes to resemble the normal gut microbial community composition of the recipient host. Thus, differences in community structure between zebrafish and mice arise in part from distinct selective pressures imposed within the gut habitat of each host. Nonetheless, vertebrate responses to microbial colonization of the gut are ancient: Functional genomic studies disclosed shared host responses to their compositionally distinct microbial communities and distinct microbial species that elicit conserved responses.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Neurotransmitter receptors are generally clustered in the postsynaptic membrane. The mechanism of clustering was analyzed with fibroblast cell lines that were stably transfected with the four subunits for fetal (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) or adult (alpha, beta, epsilon, delta) type mouse muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Immunofluorescent staining indicated that AChRs were dispersed on the surface of these cells. When transiently transfected with an expression construct encoding a 43-kilodalton protein that is normally concentrated under the postsynaptic membrane, AChRs expressed in these cells became aggregated in large cell-surface clusters, colocalized with the 43-kilodalton protein. This suggests that 43-kilodalton protein can induce AChR clustering and that cluster induction involves direct contact between AChR and 43-kilodalton protein.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In Arabidopsis thaliana, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct cytosine methylation at endogenous DNA repeats in a pathway involving two forms of nuclear RNA polymerase IV (Pol IVa and Pol IVb), RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2), DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3), ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4), the chromatin remodeler DRD1, and the de novo cytosine methyltransferase DRM2. We show that RDR2, DCL3, AGO4, and NRPD1b (the largest subunit of Pol IVb) colocalize with siRNAs within the nucleolus. By contrast, Pol IVa and DRD1 are external to the nucleolus and colocalize with endogenous repeat loci. Mutation-induced loss of pathway proteins causes downstream proteins to mislocalize, revealing their order of action. Pol IVa acts first, and its localization is RNA dependent, suggesting an RNA template. We hypothesize that maintenance of the heterochromatic state involves locus-specific Pol IVa transcription followed by siRNA production and assembly of AGO4- and NRPD1b-containing silencing complexes within nucleolar processing centers.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) protein kinase mediates early cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated during metabolic processes or by DNA-damaging agents. ATM deficiency leads to ataxia-telangiectasia, a disease marked by lymphopenia, genomic instability and an increased predisposition to lymphoid malignancies with chromosomal translocations involving lymphocyte antigen receptor loci. ATM activates cell-cycle checkpoints and can induce apoptosis in response to DNA DSBs. However, defects in these pathways of the DNA damage response cannot fully account for the phenotypes of ATM deficiency. Here, we show that ATM also functions directly in the repair of chromosomal DNA DSBs by maintaining DNA ends in repair complexes generated during lymphocyte antigen receptor gene assembly. When coupled with the cell-cycle checkpoint and pro-apoptotic activities of ATM, these findings provide a molecular explanation for the increase in lymphoid tumours with translocations involving antigen receptor loci associated with ataxia-telangiectasia.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Molecular cloning of the t(10;14)(q24;q11) recurrent breakpoint of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has demonstrated a transcript for the candidate gene TCL3. Characterization of this gene from chromosome segment 10q24 revealed it to be a new homeobox, HOX11. The HOX11 homeodomain is most similar to that of the murine gene Hlx and possesses a markedly glycine-rich variable region and an acidic carboxyl terminus. HOX11, while expressed in liver, was not detected in normal thymus or T cells. This lineage-restricted homeobox gene is deregulated upon translocation into the T cell receptor locus where it may act as an oncogene.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Some features of the visual cortex develop postnatally in mammals. For example, geniculocortical axons that initially overlap throughout cortical layer IV segregate postnatally into two sets of interleaved eye-specific bands. NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors are necessary for eye-specific axon-segregation in the frog tectum, and as NMDA receptors play a greater part in synaptic transmission in early life and decrease in function during the period of axon segregation, they may be involved in the segregation of geniculocortical axons: they are well placed to do so as they transduce retinally derived signals essential for segregation. Rearing animals in the dark in early life delays segregation and prolongs the critical period for plasticity. We now report that dark-rearing of kittens also delays the loss of NMDA receptor function in the visual cortex, supporting the view that they play an important part in neuronal development and plasticity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We have identified a receptor in hepatic endothelial and Kupffer cells that binds oligosaccharides terminating with the sequence SO4-4GalNAc beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,2-Man alpha (S4GGnM). This receptor can account for the rapid removal of the glycoprotein hormone lutropin, which bears unique Asn-linked oligosaccharides terminating in S4GGnM, from the circulation. Hepatic endothelial cells express 579,000 S4GGnM receptors at their surface and bind lutropin with an apparent Kd of 1.63 x 10(-7) M. Bound ligand is rapidly internalized. Binding does not require divalent cations, is reversed by incubation at pH 5.0 or below, and is inhibited by fucoidin but not by hyaluronate, heparin, chondroitin sulfate, or dextran sulfate. We propose that the S4GGnM-specific receptor represents a major mechanism for clearance of certain sulfated glycoproteins from the blood, including members of the glycoprotein hormone family.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Most RNA molecules require Mg(2+) for their structure and enzymatic properties. Here we report the first example of an RNA serving as sensor for cytoplasmic Mg(2+). We establish that expression of the Mg(2+) transporter MgtA of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is controlled by its 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). We show that the 5'UTR of the mgtA gene can adopt different stem-loop structures depending on the Mg(2+) levels, which determine whether transcription reads through into the mgtA coding region or stops within the 5'UTR. We could recapitulate the Mg(2+)-regulated transcription using a defined in vitro transcription system with RNA polymerase as the only protein component. The initiation of mgtA transcription responds to extracytoplasmic Mg(2+) and its elongation into the coding region to cytoplasmic Mg(2+), providing a singular example in which the same ligand is sensed in different cellular compartments to regulate disparate steps in gene transcription.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Type 1 diabetes mellitus results from the autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and is recapitulated in the nonobese diabetic strain of mice. In an attempt to rescue islet loss, diabetic mice were made normoglycemic by islet transplantation and immunization with Freund's complete adjuvant along with multiple injections of allogeneic male splenocytes. This treatment allowed for survival of transplanted islets and recovery of endogenous beta cell function in a proportion of mice, but with no evidence for allogeneic splenocyte-derived differentiation of new islet beta cells. Control of the autoimmune disease at a crucial time in diabetogenesis can result in recovery of beta cell function.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In responding to cytoplasmic nucleotide levels, ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel activity provides a unique link between cellular energetics and electrical excitability. Over the past ten years, a steady drumbeat of crystallographic and electrophysiological studies has led to detailed structural and kinetic models that define the molecular basis of channel activity. In parallel, the uncovering of disease-causing mutations of K(ATP) has led to an explanation of the molecular basis of disease and, in turn, to a better understanding of the structural basis of channel function.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Coagulation factor XI is activated in vitro by factor XIIa in the presence of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) and a negatively charged surface. Factor XII deficiency is not associated with bleeding, which suggests that another mechanism for factor XI activation exists in vivo. A revised model of coagulation is proposed in which factor XI is activated by thrombin. In the absence of cofactors, thrombin is more effective (kcat/Km = 1.6 x 10(5)) than factor XIIa (1.7 x 10(4)) in activating factor XI. Dextran sulfate enhances activation of factor XI by thrombin 2000-fold; part of this effect is due to autoactivation of factor XI by activated factor XI.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Activation of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is required for signal transduction during T cell activation, although the pathway used during thymic selection is unknown. An in vitro system was established in which T cell receptor transgenic thymocytes underwent clonal deletion in response to peptide antigen. The effects of two PTK-specific inhibitors, herbimycin A and genistein, on the clonal deletion of immature thymocytes and the activation of mature thymocytes were examined. Clonal deletion occurred while T cell activation was inhibited and when no p56lck activity was evident. Thus, p56lck is not required for the antigen-stimulated step of clonal deletion of immature thymocytes, and negative selection proceeds via a distinct pathway.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the human epidemic-causing dengue, yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses. In establishing infection these icosahedral viruses undergo endosomal membrane fusion catalysed by envelope glycoprotein rearrangement of the putative receptor-binding domain III (DIII) and exposure of the hydrophobic fusion loop. Humoral immunity has an essential protective function early in the course of West Nile virus infection. Here, we investigate the mechanism of neutralization by the E16 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds DIII. Structurally, the E16 antibody Fab fragment engages 16 residues positioned on four loops of DIII, a consensus neutralizing epitope sequence conserved in West Nile virus and distinct in other flaviviruses. The E16 epitope protrudes from the surface of mature virions in three distinct environments, and docking studies predict Fab binding will leave five-fold clustered epitopes exposed. We also show that E16 inhibits infection primarily at a step after viral attachment, potentially by blocking envelope glycoprotein conformational changes. Collectively, our results suggest that a vaccine strategy targeting the dominant DIII epitope may elicit safe and effective immune responses against flaviviral diseases.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Division of spermatogonial stem cells produces daughter cells that either maintain their stem cell identity or undergo differentiation to form mature sperm. The Sertoli cell, the only somatic cell within seminiferous tubules, provides the stem cell niche through physical support and expression of surface proteins and soluble factors. Here we show that the Ets related molecule (ERM) is expressed exclusively within Sertoli cells in the testis and is required for spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal. Mice with targeted disruption of ERM have a loss of maintenance of spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal without a block in normal spermatogenic differentiation and thus have progressive germ-cell depletion and a Sertoli-cell-only syndrome. Microarray analysis of primary Sertoli cells from ERM-deficient mice showed alterations in secreted factors known to regulate the haematopoietic stem cell niche. These results identify a new function for the Ets family transcription factors in spermatogenesis and provide an example of transcriptional control of a vertebrate stem cell niche.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Self versus non-self discrimination is a central theme in biology from plants to vertebrates, and is particularly relevant for lymphocytes that express receptors capable of recognizing self-tissues and foreign invaders. Comprising the third largest lymphocyte population, natural killer (NK) cells recognize and kill cellular targets and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. These potentially self-destructive effector functions can be controlled by inhibitory receptors for the polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules that are ubiquitously expressed on target cells. However, inhibitory receptors are not uniformly expressed on NK cells, and are germline-encoded by a set of polymorphic genes that segregate independently from MHC genes. Therefore, how NK-cell self-tolerance arises in vivo is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that NK cells acquire functional competence through 'licensing' by self-MHC molecules. Licensing involves a positive role for MHC-specific inhibitory receptors and requires the cytoplasmic inhibitory motif originally identified in effector responses. This process results in two types of self-tolerant NK cells--licensed or unlicensed--and may provide new insights for exploiting NK cells in immunotherapy. This self-tolerance mechanism may be more broadly applicable within the vertebrate immune system because related germline-encoded inhibitory receptors are widely expressed on other immune cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Gusev crater was selected as the landing site for the Spirit rover because of the possibility that it once held a lake. Thus one of the rover's tasks was to search for evidence of lake sediments. However, the plains at the landing site were found to be covered by a regolith composed of olivine-rich basaltic rock and windblown 'global' dust. The analyses of three rock interiors exposed by the rock abrasion tool showed that they are similar to one another, consistent with having originated from a common lava flow. Here we report the investigation of soils, rock coatings and rock interiors by the Spirit rover from sol (martian day) 1 to sol 156, from its landing site to the base of the Columbia hills. The physical and chemical characteristics of the materials analysed provide evidence for limited but unequivocal interaction between water and the volcanic rocks of the Gusev plains. This evidence includes the softness of rock interiors that contain anomalously high concentrations of sulphur, chlorine and bromine relative to terrestrial basalts and martian meteorites; sulphur, chlorine and ferric iron enrichments in multilayer coatings on the light-toned rock Mazatzal; high bromine concentration in filled vugs and veins within the plains basalts; positive correlations between magnesium, sulphur and other salt components in trench soils; and decoupling of sulphur, chlorine and bromine concentrations in trench soils compared to Gusev surface soils, indicating chemical mobility and separation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The observations that atherosclerosis often occurs in non-smokers without elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and that most atherosclerosis loci so far identified in mice do not affect systemic risk factors associated with atherosclerosis, suggest that as-yet-unidentified mechanisms must contribute to vascular disease. Arterial walls undergo regional disturbances of metabolism that include the uncoupling of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, a process that occurs to some extent in all cells and may be characteristic of blood vessels being predisposed to the development of atherosclerosis. To test the hypothesis that inefficient metabolism in blood vessels promotes vascular disease, we generated mice with doxycycline-inducible expression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in the artery wall. Here we show that UCP1 expression in aortic smooth muscle cells causes hypertension and increases dietary atherosclerosis without affecting cholesterol levels. UCP1 expression also increases superoxide production and decreases the availability of nitric oxide, evidence of oxidative stress. These results provide proof of principle that inefficient metabolism in blood vessels can cause vascular disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Human chromosome 2 is unique to the human lineage in being the product of a head-to-head fusion of two intermediate-sized ancestral chromosomes. Chromosome 4 has received attention primarily related to the search for the Huntington's disease gene, but also for genes associated with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, polycystic kidney disease and a form of muscular dystrophy. Here we present approximately 237 million base pairs of sequence for chromosome 2, and 186 million base pairs for chromosome 4, representing more than 99.6% of their euchromatic sequences. Our initial analyses have identified 1,346 protein-coding genes and 1,239 pseudogenes on chromosome 2, and 796 protein-coding genes and 778 pseudogenes on chromosome 4. Extensive analyses confirm the underlying construction of the sequence, and expand our understanding of the structure and evolution of mammalian chromosomes, including gene deserts, segmental duplications and highly variant regions.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Germ-free mice were maintained on polysaccharide-rich or simple-sugar diets and colonized for 10 days with an organism also found in human guts, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, followed by whole-genome transcriptional profiling of bacteria and mass spectrometry of cecal glycans. We found that these bacteria assembled on food particles and mucus, selectively induced outer-membrane polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycoside hydrolases, prioritized the consumption of liberated hexose sugars, and revealed a capacity to turn to host mucus glycans when polysaccharides were absent from the diet. This flexible foraging behavior should contribute to ecosystem stability and functional diversity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The distal human intestine represents an anaerobic bioreactor programmed with an enormous population of bacteria, dominated by relatively few divisions that are highly diverse at the strain/subspecies level. This microbiota and its collective genomes (microbiome) provide us with genetic and metabolic attributes we have not been required to evolve on our own, including the ability to harvest otherwise inaccessible nutrients. New studies are revealing how the gut microbiota has coevolved with us and how it manipulates and complements our biology in ways that are mutually beneficial. We are also starting to understand how certain keystone members of the microbiota operate to maintain the stability and functional adaptability of this microbial organ.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>All eukaryotes have three nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, namely, Pol I, II, and III. Interestingly, plants have catalytic subunits for a fourth nuclear polymerase, Pol IV. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that Pol IV does not functionally overlap with Pol I, II, or III and is nonessential for viability. However, disruption of the Pol IV catalytic subunit genes NRPD1 or NRPD2 inhibits heterochromatin association into chromocenters, coincident with losses in cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S gene clusters and AtSN1 retroelements. Loss of CG, CNG, and CNN methylation in Pol IV mutants implicates a partnership between Pol IV and the methyltransferase responsible for RNA-directed de novo methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, 5S gene and AtSN1 siRNAs are essentially eliminated in Pol IV mutants. The data suggest that Pol IV helps produce siRNAs that target de novo cytosine methylation events required for facultative heterochromatin formation and higher-order heterochromatin associations.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the related medial wall play a critical role in recruiting cognitive control. Although ACC exhibits selective error and conflict responses, it has been unclear how these develop and become context-specific. With use of a modified stop-signal task, we show from integrated computational neural modeling and neuroimaging studies that ACC learns to predict error likelihood in a given context, even for trials in which there is no error or response conflict. These results support a more general error-likelihood theory of ACC function based on reinforcement learning, of which conflict and error detection are special cases.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The first Mesoamerican civilization, the Gulf Coast Olmec, is associated with hierarchical society, monumental art, and an internally consistent ideology, expressed in a distinct style and salient iconography. Whether the Olmec style arose in just one area or emerged from interactions among scattered contemporaneous societies remains controversial. Using elemental analysis, we determined the regional clay sources of 725 archaeological ceramic samples from across Mesoamerica. Exported Olmec-style ceramics originated from the San Lorenzo region of the Gulf Coast, supporting Olmec priority in the creation and spread of the first unified style and iconographic system in Mesoamerica.</p>

Identification of crystalline water in kieserite (MgSO4.H2O) is linked to materials exposed in a valley and plateau to the north of hematite-bearing plains. The mineralogical similarities between the etched terrain deposits examined with OMEGA data and the layered rocks examined by Opportunity imply that the ancient aqueous environments inferred from analyses of the rover data extend over regional scales.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Electrical activity in neurons is generally initiated in dendritic processes then propagated along axons to synapses, where it is passed to other neurons. Major structural features of neurons-their dendrites and axons-are thus related to their fundamental functions: the receipt and transmission of information. The acquisition of these distinct properties by dendrites and axons, called polarization, is a critical step in neuronal differentiation. We show here that SAD-A and SAD-B, mammalian orthologs of a kinase needed for presynaptic differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans, are required for neuronal polarization. These kinases will provide entry points for unraveling signaling mechanisms that polarize neurons.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Genetic studies have elucidated mechanisms that regulate aging, but there has been little progress in identifying drugs that delay aging. Here, we report that ethosuximide, trimethadione, and 3,3-diethyl-2-pyrrolidinone increase mean and maximum life-span of Caenorhabditis elegans and delay age-related declines of physiological processes, indicating that these compounds retard the aging process. These compounds, two of which are approved for human use, are anticonvulsants that modulate neural activity. These compounds also regulated neuromuscular activity in nematodes. These findings suggest that the life-span-extending activity of these compounds is related to the anticonvulsant activity and implicate neural activity in the regulation of aging.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Formation of synaptic connections requires alignment of neurotransmitter receptors on postsynaptic dendrites opposite matching transmitter release sites on presynaptic axons. beta-neurexins and neuroligins form a trans-synaptic link at glutamate synapses. We show here that neurexin alone is sufficient to induce glutamate postsynaptic differentiation in contacting dendrites. Surprisingly, neurexin also induces GABA postsynaptic differentiation. Conversely, neuroligins induce presynaptic differentiation in both glutamate and GABA axons. Whereas neuroligins-1, -3, and -4 localize to glutamate postsynaptic sites, neuroligin-2 localizes primarily to GABA synapses. Direct aggregation of neuroligins reveals a linkage of neuroligin-2 to GABA and glutamate postsynaptic proteins, but the other neuroligins only to glutamate postsynaptic proteins. Furthermore, mislocalized expression of neuroligin-2 disperses postsynaptic proteins and disrupts synaptic transmission. Our findings indicate that the neurexin-neuroligin link is a core component mediating both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptogenesis, and differences in isoform localization and binding affinities may contribute to appropriate differentiation and specificity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Strategies for assembling large, complex genomes have evolved to include a combination of whole-genome shotgun sequencing and hierarchal map-assisted sequencing. Whole-genome maps of all types can aid genome assemblies, generally starting with low-resolution cytogenetic maps and ending with the highest resolution of sequence. Fingerprint clone maps are based upon complete restriction enzyme digests of clones representative of the target genome, and ultimately comprise a near-contiguous path of clones across the genome. Such clone-based maps are used to validate sequence assembly order, supply long-range linking information for assembled sequences, anchor sequences to the genetic map and provide templates for closing gaps. Fingerprint maps are also a critical resource for subsequent functional genomic studies, because they provide a redundant and ordered sampling of the genome with clones. In an accompanying paper we describe the draft genome sequence of the chicken, Gallus gallus, the first species sequenced that is both a model organism and a global food source. Here we present a clone-based physical map of the chicken genome at 20-fold coverage, containing 260 contigs of overlapping clones. This map represents approximately 91% of the chicken genome and enables identification of chicken clones aligned to positions in other sequenced genomes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Synapse formation requires the differentiation of a functional nerve terminal opposite a specialized postsynaptic membrane. Here, we show that laminin beta2, a component of the synaptic cleft at the neuromuscular junction, binds directly to calcium channels that are required for neurotransmitter release from motor nerve terminals. This interaction leads to clustering of channels, which in turn recruit other presynaptic components. Perturbation of this interaction in vivo results in disassembly of neurotransmitter release sites, resembling defects previously observed in an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. These results identify an extracellular ligand of the voltage-gated calcium channel as well as a new laminin receptor. They also suggest a model for the development of nerve terminals, and provide clues to the pathogenesis of a synaptic disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The location of the Opportunity landing site was determined to better than 10-m absolute accuracy from analyses of radio tracking data. We determined Rover locations during traverses with an error as small as several centimeters using engineering telemetry and overlapping images. Topographic profiles generated from rover data show that the plains are very smooth from meter- to centimeter-length scales, consistent with analyses of orbital observations. Solar cell output decreased because of the deposition of airborne dust on the panels. The lack of dust-covered surfaces on Meridiani Planum indicates that high velocity winds must remove this material on a continuing basis. The low mechanical strength of the evaporitic rocks as determined from grinding experiments, and the abundance of coarse-grained surface particles argue for differential erosion of Meridiani Planum.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Cellular locomotion could be driven by the rearward transport of membrane-bound particles observed on motile fibroblasts, keratinocytes and neuronal growth cones. A force propelling free surface particles backwards could move the cell forwards if the particles were anchored to a rigid substratum. During capping, myosin II ('double-headed' myosin) draws crosslinked membrane proteins to the rear of a cell. The mhcA- mutant of the amoebal stage of the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum, in which the myosin II gene has been deleted, cannot cap surface particles but can crawl along the substratum. Thus, the mechanism driving capping is not essential for locomotion. We show here that the null mutant is capable of a different type of active rearward transport, independent of myosin II and distinct from capping. The transported particles on mhcA- cells follow parallel paths. In the wild-type Ax2 strain, myosin II causes particles to converge towards a focal point and significantly increases the velocity of transport behind the leading edge of the cell.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The role of behaviour in evolutionary change has long been debated. On the one hand, behavioural changes may expose individuals to new selective pressures by altering the way that organisms interact with the environment, thus driving evolutionary divergence. Alternatively, behaviour can act to retard evolutionary change: by altering behavioural patterns in the face of new environmental conditions, organisms can minimize exposure to new selective pressures. This constraining influence of behaviour has been put forward as an explanation for evolutionary stasis within lineages and niche conservatism within clades. Nonetheless, the hypothesis that behavioural change prevents natural selection from operating in new environments has never been experimentally tested. We conducted a controlled and replicated experimental study of selection in entirely natural populations; we demonstrate that lizards alter their habitat use in the presence of an introduced predator, but that these behavioural shifts do not prevent patterns of natural selection from changing in experimental populations.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We previously documented a greater than 100-fold rostrocaudal gradient of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression in the muscles of adult mice that bear a myosin light chain-CAT transgene: successively more caudal muscles express successively higher levels of CAT. Here we studied the development and maintenance of this positional information in vitro. CAT levels reflect the rostrocaudal positions of the muscles from which the cells are derived in cultures established from adult muscles, in clones derived from individual adult myogenic (satellite) cells, in cultures prepared from embryonic myoblasts, and in cell lines derived by retrovirus-mediated transfer of an oncogene to satellite cells. Our results suggest that myoblasts bear a positional memory that is established in embryos, retained in adults, cell autonomous, heritable, stable to transformation, and accessible to study in clonal cell lines.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Although tetrameric hemoglobin has been studied extensively as a prototype for understanding mechanisms of allosteric regulation, the functional and structural properties of its eight intermediate ligation forms have remained elusive. Recent experiments on the energetics of cooperativity of these intermediates, along with assignments of their quaternary structures, have revealed that the allosteric mechanism is controlled by a previously unrecognized symmetry feature: quaternary switching from form T to form R occurs whenever heme-site binding creates a tetramer with at least one ligated subunit on each dimeric half-molecule. This "symmetry rule" translates the configurational isomers of heme-site ligation into six observed switchpoints of quaternary transition. Cooperativity arises from both "concerted" quaternary switching and "sequential" modulation of binding within each quaternary form, T and R. Binding affinity is regulated through a hierarchical code of tertiary-quaternary coupling that includes the classical allosteric models as limiting cases.</p>

(2004) describe the identification of an insect galectin as the receptor for the stage-specific Leishmania adhesin lipophosphoglycan (LPG). This interaction is critical for parasite survival in the midgut of its sand fly vector. The results open new avenues for studies of insect immunity, transmission binding vaccines, and host-parasite coevolution.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The embryonic chicken iris constricts to light ex vivo, but with characteristics atypical of visual phototransduction. The chick iris was most sensitive to short-wavelength light, demonstrating an action spectrum consistent with cryptochrome rather than with opsin pigments. Pupillary responses did not attenuate after saturating light exposure, but showed paradoxical potentiation. Iris photosensitivity was not affected by retinoid depletion or inhibitors of visual phototransduction. Knockdown of cryptochrome expression, but not of melanopsin expression, decreased iris photosensitivity. These data characterize a non-opsin photoreception mechanism in a vertebrate eye and suggest a conserved photoreceptive role for cryptochromes in vertebrates.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We show that activated collagenase (MMP-1) moves processively on the collagen fibril. The mechanism of movement is a biased diffusion with the bias component dependent on the proteolysis of its substrate, not adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. Inactivation of the enzyme by a single amino acid residue substitution in the active center eliminates the bias without noticeable effect on rate of diffusion. Monte Carlo simulations using a model similar to a "burnt bridge" Brownian ratchet accurately describe our experimental results and previous observations on kinetics of collagen digestion. The biological implications of MMP-1 acting as a molecular ratchet tethered to the cell surface suggest new mechanisms for its role in tissue remodeling and cell-matrix interaction.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We report here the discovery of a Miocene hominoid from Berg Aukas, Namibia, the first known from the African continent south of equatorial East Africa. This represents a major range extension of Miocene Hominoidea in Africa to latitude 20 degrees S. The holotype, a right mandibular corpus preserving the crowns of the P4-M3, partial crown and root of the P3, partial root of the canine, alveoli for all four incisors, and partial alveolus for the left canine, was found during paleontological explorations of karst-fill breccias in the Otavi region of northern Namibia. The mandible has unique characteristics that differentiate it from other middle Miocene hominoids of Africa and Eurasia and represents the only fossil evidence documenting a pre-australopithecine stage of hominoid evolution in southern Africa. Faunal analyses indicate that the breccia block containing the specimen accumulated during the latter part of the middle Miocene, about 13 +/- 1 Myr. Fauna from other breccia blocks at Berg Aukas are of diverse ages, including the earlier part of the middle Miocene, the upper Miocene, Plio-Pleistocene and Holocene.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A genetic paradox exists in invasion biology: how do introduced populations, whose genetic variation has probably been depleted by population bottlenecks, persist and adapt to new conditions? Lessons from conservation genetics show that reduced genetic variation due to genetic drift and founder effects limits the ability of a population to adapt, and small population size increases the risk of extinction. Nonetheless, many introduced species experiencing these same conditions during initial introductions persist, expand their ranges, evolve rapidly and become invasive. To address this issue, we studied the brown anole, a worldwide invasive lizard. Genetic analyses indicate that at least eight introductions have occurred in Florida from across this lizard's native range, blending genetic variation from different geographic source populations and producing populations that contain substantially more, not less, genetic variation than native populations. Moreover, recently introduced brown anole populations around the world originate from Florida, and some have maintained these elevated levels of genetic variation. Here we show that one key to invasion success may be the occurrence of multiple introductions that transform among-population variation in native ranges to within-population variation in introduced areas. Furthermore, these genetically variable populations may be particularly potent sources for introductions elsewhere. The growing problem of invasive species introductions brings considerable economic and biological costs. If these costs are to be mitigated, a greater understanding of the causes, progression and consequences of biological invasions is needed.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The Escherichia coli Rep helicase unwinds duplex DNA during replication. The functional helicase appears to be a dimer that forms only on binding DNA. Both protomers of the dimer can bind either single-stranded or duplex DNA. Because binding and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are essential for helicase function, the energetics of DNA binding and DNA-induced Rep dimerization were studied quantitatively in the presence of the nucleotide cofactors adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPP(NH)P. Large allosteric effects of nucleotide cofactors on DNA binding to Rep were observed. Binding of ADP favored Rep dimers in which both protomers bound single-stranded DNA, whereas binding of AMPP(NH)P favored simultaneous binding of both single-stranded and duplex DNA to the Rep dimer. A rolling model for the active unwinding of duplex DNA by the dimeric Rep helicase is proposed that explains vectorial unwinding and predicts that helicase translocation along DNA is coupled to ATP binding, whereas ATP hydrolysis drives unwinding of multiple DNA base pairs for each catalytic event.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The skull of living crocodylians is highly solidified and the jaw closing muscles are enlarged, allowing for prey capture by prolonged crushing between the jaws. Living species are all semi-aquatic, with sprawling limbs and a broad body that moves mainly from side-to-side; however, fossils indicate that they evolved from terrestrial forms. The most cursorial of these fossils are small, gracile forms often grouped together as the Sphenosuchia, with fully erect, slender limbs; their relationships, however, are poorly understood. A new crocodylomorph from deposits in northwestern China of the poorly known Middle Jurassic epoch possesses a skull with several adaptations typical of living crocodylians. Postcranially it is similar to sphenosuchians but with even greater adaptations for cursoriality in the forelimb. Here we show, through phylogenetic analysis, that it is the closest relative of the large group Crocodyliformes, including living crocodylians. Thus, important features of the modern crocodylian skull evolved during a phase when the postcranial skeleton was evolving towards greater cursoriality, rather than towards their current semi-aquatic habitus.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Axonal degeneration is an active program of self-destruction that is observed in many physiological and pathological settings. In Wallerian degeneration slow (wlds) mice, Wallerian degeneration in response to axonal injury is delayed because of a mutation that results in overexpression of a chimeric protein (Wlds) composed of the ubiquitin assembly protein Ufd2a and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthetic enzyme Nmnat1. We demonstrate that increased Nmnat activity is responsible for the axon-sparing activity of the Wlds protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SIRT1, a mammalian ortholog of Sir2, is the downstream effector of increased Nmnat activity that leads to axonal protection. These findings suggest that novel therapeutic strategies directed at increasing the supply of NAD and/or Sir2 activation may be effective for treatment of diseases characterized by axonopathy and neurodegeneration.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Most calcium-activated potassium channels couple changes in intracellular calcium to membrane excitability by conducting a current with a probability that depends directly on submembrane calcium concentration. In rat adrenal chromaffin cells, however, a large conductance, voltage- and calcium-activated potassium channel (BK) undergoes rapid inactivation, suggesting that this channel has a physiological role different than that of other BK channels. The inactivation of the BK channel, like that of the voltage-gated Shaker B potassium channel, is removed by trypsin digestion and channels are blocked by the Shaker B amino-terminal inactivating domain. Thus, this BK channel shares functional and possibly structural homologies with other inactivating voltage-gated potassium channels.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A critical step in self-motion perception and spatial awareness is the integration of motion cues from multiple sensory organs that individually do not provide an accurate representation of the physical world. One of the best-studied sensory ambiguities is found in visual processing, and arises because of the inherent uncertainty in detecting the motion direction of an untextured contour moving within a small aperture. A similar sensory ambiguity arises in identifying the actual motion associated with linear accelerations sensed by the otolith organs in the inner ear. These internal linear accelerometers respond identically during translational motion (for example, running forward) and gravitational accelerations experienced as we reorient the head relative to gravity (that is, head tilt). Using new stimulus combinations, we identify here cerebellar and brainstem motion-sensitive neurons that compute a solution to the inertial motion detection problem.

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Target-derived cues promote local differentiation of axons into nerve terminals at sites of synaptic contact. Using clustering of synaptic vesicles in cultured neurons as an assay, we purified putative target-derived presynaptic organizing molecules from mouse brain and identified FGF22 as a major active species. FGF7 and FGF10, the closest relatives of FGF22, share this activity; other FGFs have distinct effects. FGF22 is expressed by cerebellar granule cells during the period when they receive synapses. Its receptor, FGFR2, is expressed by pontine and vestibular neurons when their axons (mossy fibers) are making synapses on granule cells. Neutralization of FGF7, -10, and -22 inhibits presynaptic differentiation of mossy fibers at sites of contact with granule cells in vivo. Inactivation of FGFR2 has similar effects. These results indicate that FGF22 and its relatives are presynaptic organizing molecules in the mammalian brain and suggest new functions for this family of signaling molecules.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors before tetanic stimulation blocks long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This NMDA-mediated inhibition of LTP can be reversed by the nitric oxide (NO) inhibitors L-NG-monomethyl-arginine or hemoglobin and mimicked by sodium nitroprusside. These results indicate that the timing of NO release relative to high-frequency activation of CA1 synapses may be an important determinant of LTP generation and suggest that NO may play a positive or negative modulatory role in LTP depending on prior events at the tetanized synapse and the ambient concentration of excitatory amino acids.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Gram-positive bacteria face unique challenges in generating biologically active conformations for their exported proteins because they lack a dedicated compartment for folding secreted polypeptides. We have discovered that protein secretion by way of the general secretory (Sec) pathway in the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes proceeds through a single microdomain. Unlike other mechanisms for asymmetry involving the Sec pathway, proteins destined for secretion are targeted to a single locus distal to either cell pole that has specialized to contain the Sec translocons. This subcellular organization may represent a paradigm for secretion common to other Gram-positive pathogens with profound implications for pathogenesis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Cilia and flagella are microtubule-based structures nucleated by modified centrioles termed basal bodies. These biochemically complex organelles have more than 250 and 150 polypeptides, respectively. To identify the proteins involved in ciliary and basal body biogenesis and function, we undertook a comparative genomics approach that subtracted the nonflagellated proteome of Arabidopsis from the shared proteome of the ciliated/flagellated organisms Chlamydomonas and human. We identified 688 genes that are present exclusively in organisms with flagella and basal bodies and validated these data through a series of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo studies. We then applied this resource to the study of human ciliation disorders and have identified BBS5, a novel gene for Bardet-Biedl syndrome. We show that this novel protein localizes to basal bodies in mouse and C. elegans, is under the regulatory control of daf-19, and is necessary for the generation of both cilia and flagella.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Intracellular parasites use various strategies to invade cells and to subvert cellular signaling pathways and, thus, to gain a foothold against host defenses. Efficient cell entry, ability to exploit intracellular niches, and persistence make these parasites treacherous pathogens. Most intracellular parasites gain entry via host-mediated processes, but apicomplexans use a system of adhesion-based motility called "gliding" to actively penetrate host cells. Actin polymerization-dependent motility facilitates parasite migration across cellular barriers, enables dissemination within tissues, and powers invasion of host cells. Efficient invasion has brought widespread success to this group, which includes Toxoplasma, Plasmodium, and Cryptosporidium.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Myosin VI can move along actin filaments to serve as a transport motor. It is also thought to anchor vesicles or proteins to actin. How these two diverse activities, which require very different modes of interaction with actin, are mediated is not understood. Using single molecule observations, Altman et al. (2004 [this issue of Cell]) demonstrate that load applied to myosin VI can convert this motor from a transporter to an anchor.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We have discovered nine presolar silicate grains from the carbonaceous chondrite Acfer 094. Their anomalous oxygen isotopic compositions indicate formation in the atmospheres of evolved stars. Two grains are identified as pyroxene, two as olivine, one as a glass with embedded metal and sulfides (GEMS), and one as an Al-rich silicate. One grain is enriched in 26Mg, which is attributed to the radioactive decay of 26Al and provides information about mixing processes in the parent star. This discovery opens new means for studying stellar processes and conditions in various solar system environments.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Because hydrogen and nitrogen isotopic anomalies in interplanetary dust particles have been associated with carbonaceous material, the lack of similar anomalies in carbon has been a major conundrum. We report here the presence of a 13C depletion associated with a 15N enrichment in an anhydrous interplanetary dust particle. Our observations suggest that the anomalies are carried by heteroatomic organic compounds. Theoretical models indicate that low-temperature formation of organic compounds in cold interstellar molecular clouds can produce carbon and nitrogen fractionations, but it remains to be seen whether the specific effects observed here can be reproduced.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Forkhead transcription factors play key roles in the regulation of immune responses. Here, we identify a role for one member of this family, Foxj1, in the regulation of T cell activation and autoreactivity. Foxj1 deficiency resulted in multiorgan systemic inflammation, exaggerated Th1 cytokine production, and T cell proliferation in autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions. Foxj1 suppressed NF-kappaB transcription activity in vitro, and Foxj1-deficient T cells possessed increased NF-kappaB activity in vivo, correlating with the ability of Foxj1 to regulate IkappaB proteins, particularly IkappaBbeta. Thus, Foxj1 likely modulates inflammatory reactions and prevents autoimmunity by antagonizing proinflammatory transcriptional activities. These results suggest a potentially general role for forkhead genes in the enforcement of lymphocyte quiescence.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>During generalized immune complex-induced inflammation of the peritoneal cavity, two peaks of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were observed in the peritoneal exudate of normal mice. In mast cell-deficient mice, the first peak was undetected, and the second peak of TNF and neutrophil influx were significantly reduced. Antibody to TNF significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration in normal but not in mast cell-deficient mice. Mast cell repletion of the latter normalized TNF, neutrophil mobilization, and the effect of the antibody to TNF. Thus, in vivo, mast cells produce the TNF that augments neutrophil emigration.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The parasitic nematode Ascaris infests a billion people worldwide. Much of its proliferative success is due to prodigious egg production, up to 10(6) sterol-replete eggs per day. Sterol synthesis requires molecular oxygen for squalene epoxidation, yet oxygen is scarce in the intestinal folds the worms inhabit. Ascaris has an oxygen-avid hemoglobin in the perienteric fluid that bathes its reproductive organs. Purified hemoglobin contained tightly bound squalene and functioned as an NADPH-dependent, ferrihemoprotein reductase. All components of the squalene epoxidation reaction--squalene, oxygen, NADPH, and NADPH-dependent reductase--are assembled on the hemoglobin. This molecule may thus function in sterol biosynthesis.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The telomeres of Xq and Yq have been observed to associate during meiosis, and in rare cases a short synaptonemal complex is present. Molecular cloning of loci from Xqter and Yqter has revealed that their sequence homology extends over 400 kilobases, which suggests the possibility of genetic exchange. This hypothesis was tested by the development of two highly informative microsatellite markers from yeast artificial chromosome clones that carried Xqter sequences and the following of their inheritance in a set of reference pedigrees from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain in Paris, France. From a total of 195 informative male meioses, four recombination events between these loci were observed. In three cases, paternal X alleles were inherited by male offspring, and in one case a female offspring inherited her father's Y allele. These data support the existence of genetic exchange at Xq-Yq, which defines a second pseudoautosomal region between the sex chromosomes.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The fusion protein PML-RARalpha, generated by the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2) translocation associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), initiates APL when expressed in the early myeloid compartment of transgenic mice. PML-RARalpha is cleaved in several positions by a neutral serine protease in a human myeloid cell line; purification revealed that the protease is neutrophil elastase (NE). Immunofluorescence localization studies suggested that the cleavage of PML-RARalpha must occur within the cell, and perhaps, within the nucleus. The functional importance of NE for APL development was assessed in NE deficient mice. Greater than 90% of bone marrow PML-RARalpha cleaving activity was lost in the absence of NE, and NE (but not Cathepsin G) deficient animals were protected from APL development. Primary mouse and human APL cells also contain NE-dependent PML-RARalpha cleaving activity. Since NE is maximally produced in promyelocytes, this protease may play a role in APL pathogenesis by facilitating the leukemogenic potential of PML-RARalpha.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The immunological synapse is a specialized cell-cell junction between T cell and antigen-presenting cell surfaces. It is characterized by a central cluster of antigen receptors, a ring of integrin family adhesion molecules, and temporal stability over hours. The role of this specific organization in signaling for T cell activation has been controversial. We use in vitro and in silico experiments to determine that the immunological synapse acts as a type of adaptive controller that both boosts T cell receptor triggering and attenuates strong signals.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Mammalian myogenesis is biphasic: primary myoblasts fuse to form primary myotubes, then secondary myoblasts align along the primary myotubes and form secondary myotubes, which comprise most of adult muscle. We provide evidence that an integrin (VLA-4) and its counter receptor (VCAM-1) have a role in secondary myogenesis. Both receptors are synthesized by cultured muscle cells: VLA-4 is induced as myotubes form, whereas VCAM-1 is present on myoblasts and myotubes. In vivo, both molecules are expressed at sites of secondary myogenesis, VLA-4 on primary and secondary myotubes, and VCAM-1 on secondary myoblasts and on regions of secondary myotubes apposed to primary myotubes. These patterns suggest that VLA-4-VCAM-1 interactions influence alignment of secondary myoblasts along primary myotubes and/or the fusion of secondary myoblasts. In support of the latter possibility, antibodies to VLA-4 or VCAM-1 inhibit myotube formation in culture.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins are required for intracellular vesicular transport. Mastoparan is a peptide component of wasp venom that increases nucleotide exchange in some classes of G alpha subunits of regulatory heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). Mastoparan and other compounds that increase nucleotide exchange by G proteins inhibited endosome fusion in vitro and reversed the effects of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP-gamma-S), a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog. Addition of beta gamma subunits of G proteins to the fusion assay antagonized the stimulatory effect of GTP-gamma-S, confirming the participation of G proteins. These results indicate that GTP-binding proteins are required for endosome fusion and in particular that a G protein is involved. Given the function of G proteins in signal transduction, these findings may provide insight into the mechanism by which endosomal vesicles become competent for fusion after their formation at the cell surface.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Escherichia coli is a frequent cause of several common bacterial infections in humans and animals, including urinary tract infections, bacteraemia and bacteria-related diarrhoea and is also the main cause of neonatal meningitis. Microbial attachment to surfaces is a key event in colonization and infection and results mainly from a stereochemical fit between microbial adhesins and complementary receptors on host cells. Bacterial adhesins required for extracellular colonization by Gram-negative bacteria are often minor components of heteropolymeric fibres called pili which must be oriented in an accessible manner in these structures to be able to bind to specific receptor architectures. P pili mediate the binding of uropathogenic E. coli to a digalactoside receptor determinant present in the urinary tract epithelium. We report here that the adhesin is a component of distinct fibrillar structures present at the tips of the pili. These virulence-associated tip fibrillae are thin, flexible polymers composed mostly of repeating subunits of PapE that frequently terminate with the alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-4)-beta-D-galactopyranose or Gal alpha (1-4)Gal binding PapG adhesin.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Originally E2F sites were identified as elements in the promoters of adenovirus early genes that are necessary for activation of these genes by the early protein E1a (ref. 1). E2F promoter elements have been shown to be important for transcriptional activation of several genes critical for progression through the cell cycle. During the G1 phase of the cell cycle, the E2F protein forms a complex with the cell-cycle protein Rb (ref. 5) and it has been suggested that this binding of Rb to E2F inactivates E2F (ref. 5). Here we show that Rb-E2F is an active complex that, when bound to the E2F site, inhibits the activity of other promoter elements and thus silences transcription. We propose that the ability of this complex to inhibit transcription is integral to the function of Rb and provide evidence that E2F is a positive element in the absence of an active form of Rb. It has been shown that binding of Rb to E2F depends on the phosphorylation state of Rb (only the underphosphorylated form binds) and that the phosphorylation state of Rb changes during progression through the cell cycle. We therefore suggest that the E2F site alternates between a positive and negative element with the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of Rb. This cyclic activity may be responsible for activating and then inhibiting genes during the cell cycle.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Induction of ferritin synthesis in cultured cells by heme or iron is accompanied by degradation of the ferritin repressor protein (FRP). Intermediates in the degradative pathway apparently include FRP covalently linked in larger aggregates. The effect of iron on FRP degradation is enhanced by porphyrin precursors but is decreased by inhibitors of porphyrin synthesis, which implies that heme is an active agent. These results suggest that translational induction in this system may be caused by enhanced repressor degradation. While unique among translational regulatory systems, this process is common to a variety of other biosynthetic control mechanisms.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Steroid-thyroid hormone receptors typically bind as dimers to DNA sequences that contain repeated elements termed half-sites. NGFI-B, an early response protein and orphan member of this receptor superfamily, binds to a DNA sequence that contains only one half-site (5'-AAAGGTCA-3'). A domain separate from the NGFI-B zinc fingers, termed the A box, was identified and is required for recognition of the two adenine-thymidine (A-T) base pairs at the 5' end of the NGFI-B DNA binding element. In addition, a domain downstream of the zinc fingers of the orphan receptor H-2 region II binding protein, termed the T box, determined binding to tandem repeats of the estrogen receptor half-site (5'-AGGTCA-3').</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Leishmania infections involve an acute phase of replication within macrophages, typically associated with pathology. After recovery parasites persist for long periods, which can lead to severe disease upon reactivation. Unlike the role of host factors, parasite factors affecting persistence are poorly understood. Leishmania major lacking phosphoglycans (lpg2-) were unable to survive in sand flies and macrophages, but retained the ability to persist indefinitely in the mammalian host without inducing disease. The L. major lpg2- thus provides a platform for probing parasite factors implicated in persistence and its role in disease and immunity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>It is well established that an earthquake in the Earth's crust can trigger subsequent earthquakes, but such triggering has not been documented for deeper earthquakes. Models for shallow fault interactions suggest that static (permanent) stress changes can trigger nearby earthquakes, within a few fault lengths from the causative earthquake, whereas dynamic (transient) stresses carried by seismic waves may trigger earthquakes both nearby and at remote distances. Here we present a detailed analysis of the 19 August 2002 Tonga deep earthquake sequences and show evidence for both static and dynamic triggering. Seven minutes after a magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred at a depth of 598 km, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake (664 km depth) occurred 300 km away, in a previously aseismic region. We found that nearby aftershocks of the first mainshock are preferentially located in regions where static stresses are predicted to have been enhanced by the mainshock. But the second mainshock and other triggered events are located at larger distances where static stress increases should be negligible, thus suggesting dynamic triggering. The origin times of the triggered events do not correspond to arrival times of the main seismic waves from the mainshocks and the dynamically triggered earthquakes frequently occur in aseismic regions below or adjacent to the seismic zone. We propose that these events are triggered by transient effects in regions near criticality, but where earthquakes have difficulty nucleating without external influences.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Identification of general properties of evolutionary radiations has been hindered by the lack of a general statistical and phylogenetic approach applicable across diverse taxa. We present a comparative analytical framework for examining phylogenetic patterns of diversification and morphological disparity with data from four iguanian-lizard taxa that exhibit substantially different patterns of evolution. Taxa whose diversification occurred disproportionately early in their evolutionary history partition more of their morphological disparity among, rather than within, subclades. This inverse relationship between timing of diversification and morphological disparity within subclades may be a general feature that transcends the historically contingent properties of different evolutionary radiations.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Niche conservatism--the tendency for closely related species to be ecologically similar--is widespread. However, most studies compare closely related taxa that occur in allopatry; in sympatry, the stabilizing forces that promote niche conservatism, and thus inhibit niche shifts, may be countered by natural selection favouring ecological divergence to minimize the intensity of interspecific interactions. Consequently, the relative importance of niche conservatism versus niche divergence in determining community structure has received little attention. Here, we examine a tropical lizard community in which species have a long evolutionary history of ecological interaction. We find that evolutionary divergence overcomes niche conservatism: closely related species are no more ecologically similar than expected by random divergence and some distantly related species are ecologically similar, leading to a community in which the relationship between ecological similarity and phylogenetic relatedness is very weak. Despite this lack of niche conservatism, the ecological structuring of the community has a phylogenetic component: niche complementarity only occurs among distantly related species, which suggests that the strength of ecological interactions among species may be related to phylogeny, but it is not necessarily the most closely related species that interact most strongly.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Synaptic activity drives synaptic rearrangement in the vertebrate nervous system; indeed, this appears to be a main way in which experience shapes neural connectivity. One rearrangement that occurs in many parts of the nervous system during early postnatal life is a competitive process called 'synapse elimination'. At the neuromuscular junction, where synapse elimination has been analysed in detail, muscle fibres are initially innervated by multiple axons, then all but one are withdrawn and the 'winner' enlarges. In support of the idea that synapse elimination is activity dependent, it is slowed or speeded when total neuromuscular activity is decreased or increased, respectively. However, most hypotheses about synaptic rearrangement postulate that change depends less on total activity than on the relative activity of the competitors. Intuitively, it seems that the input best able to excite its postsynaptic target would be most likely to win the competition, but some theories and results make other predictions. Here we use a genetic method to selectively inhibit neurotransmission from one of two inputs to a single target cell. We show that more powerful inputs are strongly favoured competitors during synapse elimination.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In developing mammalian muscle, axon branches of several motor neurons co-innervate the same muscle fibre. Competition among them results in the strengthening of one and the withdrawal of the rest. It is not known why one particular axon branch survives or why some competitions resolve sooner than others. Here we show that the fate of axonal branches is strictly related to the identity of the axons with which they compete. When two neurons co-innervate multiple target cells, the losing axon branches in each contest belong to the same neuron and are at nearly the same stage of withdrawal. The axonal arbor of one neuron engages in multiple sets of competitions simultaneously. Each set proceeds at a different rate and heads towards a common outcome based on the identity of the competitor. Competitive vigour at each of these sets of local competitions depends on a globally distributed resource: neurons with larger arborizations are at a competitive disadvantage when confronting neurons with smaller arborizations. An accompanying paper tests the idea that the amount of neurotransmitter released is this global resource.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Human chromosome 7 has historically received prominent attention in the human genetics community, primarily related to the search for the cystic fibrosis gene and the frequent cytogenetic changes associated with various forms of cancer. Here we present more than 153 million base pairs representing 99.4% of the euchromatic sequence of chromosome 7, the first metacentric chromosome completed so far. The sequence has excellent concordance with previously established physical and genetic maps, and it exhibits an unusual amount of segmentally duplicated sequence (8.2%), with marked differences between the two arms. Our initial analyses have identified 1,150 protein-coding genes, 605 of which have been confirmed by complementary DNA sequences, and an additional 941 pseudogenes. Of genes confirmed by transcript sequences, some are polymorphic for mutations that disrupt the reading frame.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Escherichia coli entry into the bladder is met with potent innate defenses, including neutrophil influx and epithelial exfoliation. Bacterial subversion of innate responses involves invasion into bladder superficial cells. We discovered that the intracellular bacteria matured into biofilms, creating pod-like bulges on the bladder surface. Pods contained bacteria encased in a polysaccharide-rich matrix surrounded by a protective shell of uroplakin. Within the biofilm, bacterial structures interacted extensively with the surrounding matrix, and biofilm associated factors had regional variation in expression. The discovery of intracellular biofilm-like pods explains how bladder infections can persist in the face of robust host defenses.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>In Volvox carteri adults, reproductive cells called gonidia are enclosed within a spherical monolayer of biflagellate somatic cells. Embryos must "invert" (turn inside out) to achieve this configuration, however, because at the end of cleavage the gonidia are on the outside and the flagellar ends of all somatic cells point inward. Generation of a bend region adequate to turn the embryo inside out involves a dramatic change in cell shape, plus cell movements. Here, we cloned a gene called invA that is essential for inversion and found that it codes for a kinesin localized in the cytoplasmic bridges that link all cells to their neighbors. In invA null mutants, cells change shape normally, but are unable to move relative to the cytoplasmic bridges. A normal bend region cannot be formed and inversion stops. We conclude that the InvA kinesin provides the motile force that normally drives inversion to completion.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The basic molecular mechanisms underlying circadian oscillators follow the same general plan across the phylogenetic spectrum: oscillating feedback loops in which clock gene products negatively regulate their own expression. The circadian clocks of animals involve at least two interacting feedback loops. This Viewpoint compares and contrasts the circadian clocks of mammals and of Drosophila, emphasizing how different players are used to create the same basic script. Both the general script and the specific details of the murine and Drosophila circadian pathways are available at Science's Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment Connections Maps.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The sifting and winnowing of DNA sequence that occur during evolution cause nonfunctional sequences to diverge, leaving phylogenetic footprints of functional sequence elements in comparisons of genome sequences. We searched for such footprints among the genome sequences of six Saccharomyces species and identified potentially functional sequences. Comparison of these sequences allowed us to revise the catalog of yeast genes and identify sequence motifs that may be targets of transcriptional regulatory proteins. Some of these conserved sequence motifs reside upstream of genes with similar functional annotations or similar expression patterns or those bound by the same transcription factor and are thus good candidates for functional regulatory sequences.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Loss of CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), a component of the filtration complex in the kidney, causes death in mice at 6 weeks of age. Mice with CD2AP haploinsufficiency developed glomerular changes at 9 months of age and had increased susceptibility to glomerular injury by nephrotoxic antibodies or immune complexes. Electron microscopic analysis of podocytes revealed defects in the formation of multivesicular bodies, suggesting an impairment of the intracellular degradation pathway. Two human patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis had a mutation predicted to ablate expression of one CD2AP allele, implicating CD2AP as a determinant of human susceptibility to glomerular disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The human gut is colonized with a vast community of indigenous microorganisms that help shape our biology. Here, we present the complete genome sequence of the Gram-negative anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a dominant member of our normal distal intestinal microbiota. Its 4779-member proteome includes an elaborate apparatus for acquiring and hydrolyzing otherwise indigestible dietary polysaccharides and an associated environment-sensing system consisting of a large repertoire of extracytoplasmic function sigma factors and one- and two-component signal transduction systems. These and other expanded paralogous groups shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic host-bacterial relationships in our intestine.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Norwalk-like caliciviruses (Noroviruses) cause over 90% of nonbacterial epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide, but the pathogenesis of norovirus infection is poorly understood because these viruses do not grow in cultured cells and there is no small animal model. Here, we report a previously unknown murine norovirus. Analysis of Murine Norovirus 1 infection revealed that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-dependent innate immunity, but not T and B cell-dependent adaptive immunity, is essential for norovirus resistance. The identification of host molecules essential for murine norovirus resistance may provide targets for prevention or control of an important human disease.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We have identified six circumstellar silicate grains within interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). Their extrasolar origins are demonstrated by their extremely anomalous oxygen isotopic compositions. Three 17O-rich grains appear to originate from red giant or asymptotic giant branch stars. One 16O-rich grain may be from a metal-poor star. Two 16O-poor grains have unknown stellar sources. One of the grains is forsterite, and two are amorphous silicate "GEMS" (glass with embedded metal and sulfides), which is consistent with astronomical identifications of crystalline and amorphous silicates in the outflows of evolved stars. These observations suggest cometary origins of these IDPs and underscore the perplexing absence of silicates among circumstellar dust grains from meteorites.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The immune system must distinguish not only between self and non-self, but also between innocuous and pathological foreign antigens to prevent unnecessary or self-destructive immune responses. Unresponsiveness to harmless antigens is established through central and peripheral processes. Whereas clonal deletion and anergy are mechanisms of peripheral tolerance, active suppression by T-regulatory 1 (Tr1) cells has emerged as an essential factor in the control of autoreactive cells. Tr1 cells are CD4+ T lymphocytes that are defined by their production of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and suppression of T-helper cells; however, the physiological conditions underlying Tr1 differentiation are unknown. Here we show that co-engagement of CD3 and the complement regulator CD46 in the presence of IL-2 induces a Tr1-specific cytokine phenotype in human CD4+ T cells. These CD3/CD46-stimulated IL-10-producing CD4+ cells proliferate strongly, suppress activation of bystander T cells and acquire a memory phenotype. Our findings identify an endogenous receptor-mediated event that drives Tr1 differentiation and suggest that the complement system has a previously unappreciated role in T-cell-mediated immunity and tolerance.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The global predominance of three clonal Toxoplasma gondii lineages suggests that they are endowed with an exceptional trait responsible for their current parasitism of nearly all warm-blooded vertebrates. Genetic polymorphism analyses indicate that these clonal lineages emerged within the last 10,000 years after a single genetic cross. Comparison with ancient strains (approximately 1 million years) suggests that the success of the clonal lineages resulted from the concurrent acquisition of direct oral infectivity. This key adaptation circumvented sexual recombination, simultaneously promoting transmission through successive hosts, hence leading to clonal expansion. Thus, changes in complex life cycles can occur rapidly and can profoundly influence pathogenicity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The influx of inflammatory cells to sites of injury is largely directed by signals from the epithelium, but how these cells form chemotactic gradients is not known. In matrilysin null mice, neutrophils remained confined in the interstitium of injured lungs and did not advance into the alveolar space. Impaired transepithelial migration was accompanied by a lack of both shed syndecan-1, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and KC, a CXC chemokine, in the alveolar fluid. KC was bound to shed syndecan-1, and it was not detected in the lavage of syndecan-1 null mice. In vitro, matrilysin cleaved syndecan-1 from the surface of cells. Thus, matrilysin-mediated shedding of syndecan-1/KC complexes from the mucosal surface directs and confines neutrophil influx to sites of injury.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Periplasmic chaperones direct the assembly of adhesive, multi-subunit pilus fibers that play critical roles in bacterial pathogenesis. Pilus assembly occurs via a donor strand exchange mechanism in which the N-terminal extension of one subunit replaces the chaperone G(1) strand that transiently occupies a groove in the neighboring subunit. Here, we show that the chaperone primes the subunit for assembly by holding the groove in an open, activated conformation. During donor strand exchange, the subunit undergoes a topological transition that triggers the closure of the groove and seals the N-terminal extension in place. It is this topological transition, made possible only by the priming action of the chaperone that drives subunit assembly into the fiber.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Good health, which reflects the harmonious integration of molecules, cells, tissues and organs, is dynamically stable: when displaced by disease, compensation and correction are common, even without medical care. Physiology and computational biology now suggest that healthy dynamic stability arises through the combination of specific feedback mechanisms and spontaneous properties of interconnected networks. Today's physicians are already testing to 'see if the network is right'; tomorrow's physicians may well use therapies to 'make the network right'.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The M3 protein encoded by murine gamma herpesvirus68 (gamma HV68) functions as an immune system saboteur by the engagement of chemoattractant cytokines, thereby altering host antiviral inflammatory responses. Here we report the crystal structures of M3 both alone and in complex with the CC chemokine MCP-1. M3 is a two-domain beta sandwich protein with a unique sequence and topology, forming a tightly packed anti-parallel dimer. The stoichiometry of the MCP-1:M3 complex is 2:2, with two monomeric chemokines embedded at distal ends of the preassociated M3 dimer. Conformational flexibility and electrostatic complementation are both used by M3 to achieve high-affinity and broad-spectrum chemokine engagement. M3 also employs structural mimicry to promiscuously sequester chemokines, engaging conservative structural elements associated with both chemokine homodimerization and binding to G protein-coupled receptors.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The therapeutic value of DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents is dependent upon their ability to induce tumor cell apoptosis while sparing most normal tissues. Here, we show that a component of the apoptotic response to these agents in several different types of tumor cells is the deamidation of two asparagines in the unstructured loop of Bcl-xL, and we demonstrate that deamidation of these asparagines imports susceptibility to apoptosis by disrupting the ability of Bcl-xL to block the proapoptotic activity of BH3 domain-only proteins. Conversely, Bcl-xL deamidation is actively suppressed in fibroblasts, and suppression of deamidation is an essential component of their resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that the regulation of Bcl-xL deamidation has a critical role in the tumor-specific activity of DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A major determinant of specific connectivity in the central nervous system is that synapses made by distinct afferent populations are restricted to particular laminae in their target area. We identify Sidekick (Sdk)-1 and -2, homologous transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily molecules that mediate homophilic adhesion in vitro and direct laminar targeting of neurites in vivo. sdk-1 and -2 are expressed by nonoverlapping subsets of retinal neurons; each sdk is expressed by presynaptic (amacrine and bipolar) and postsynaptic (ganglion) cells that project to common inner plexiform (synaptic) sublaminae. Sdk proteins are concentrated at synaptic sites, and Sdk-positive synapses are restricted to the 2 (of &gt; or =10) sublaminae to which sdk-expressing cells project. Ectopic expression of Sdk in Sdk-negative cells redirects their processes to a Sdk-positive sublamina. These results implicate Sdks as determinants of lamina-specific synaptic connectivity.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The Golgi-localized, gamma-ear-containing, adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-binding proteins (GGAs) are multidomain proteins that bind mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) in the Golgi and have an essential role in lysosomal enzyme sorting. Here the GGAs and the coat protein adaptor protein-1 (AP-1) were shown to colocalize in clathrin-coated buds of the trans-Golgi networks of mouse L cells and human HeLa cells. Binding studies revealed a direct interaction between the hinge domains of the GGAs and the gamma-ear domain of AP-1. Further, AP-1 contained bound casein kinase-2 that phosphorylated GGA1 and GGA3, thereby causing autoinhibition. This could induce the directed transfer of the MPRs from GGAs to AP-1. MPRs that are defective in binding to GGAs are poorly incorporated into AP-1-containing clathrin-coated vesicles. Thus, the GGAs and AP-1 interact to package MPRs into AP-1-containing coated vesicles.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Large conductance, Ca(2+)- and voltage-activated K(+) channels (BK) respond to two distinct physiological signals -- membrane voltage and cytosolic Ca(2+) (refs 1, 2). Channel opening is regulated by changes in Ca(2+) concentration spanning 0.5 micro M to 50 mM (refs 2-5), a range of Ca(2+) sensitivity unusual among Ca(2+)-regulated proteins. Although voltage regulation arises from mechanisms shared with other voltage-gated channels, the mechanisms of Ca(2+) regulation remain largely unknown. One potential Ca(2+)-regulatory site, termed the 'Ca(2+) bowl', has been located to the large cytosolic carboxy terminus. Here we show that a second region of the C terminus, the RCK domain (regulator of conductance for K(+) (ref. 12)), contains residues that define two additional regulatory effects of divalent cations. One site, together with the Ca(2+) bowl, accounts for all physiological regulation of BK channels by Ca(2+); the other site contributes to effects of millimolar divalent cations that may mediate physiological regulation by cytosolic Mg(2+) (refs 5, 13). Independent regulation by multiple sites explains the large concentration range over which BK channels are regulated by Ca(2+). This allows BK channels to serve a variety of physiological roles contingent on the Ca(2+) concentration to which the channels are exposed.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Complement is a component of natural immunity. Its regulation is needed to protect tissues from inflammation, but mice with a disrupted gene for the complement regulator decay accelerating factor were normal. Mice that were deficient in another murine complement regulator, Crry, were generated to investigate its role in vivo. Survival of Crry-/- embryos was compromised because of complement deposition and concomitant placenta inflammation. Complement activation at the fetomaternal interface caused the fetal loss because breeding to C3-/- mice rescued Crry-/- mice from lethality. Thus, the regulation of complement is critical in fetal control of maternal processes that mediate tissue damage.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The mechanisms by which circadian pacemaker systems transmit timing information to control behavior are largely unknown. Here, we define two critical features of that mechanism in Drosophila. We first describe animals mutant for the pdf neuropeptide gene, which is expressed by most of the candidate pacemakers (LNv neurons). Next, we describe animals in which pdf neurons were selectively ablated. Both sets of animals produced similar behavioral phenotypes. Both sets entrained to light, but both were largely arrhythmic under constant conditions. A minority of each pdf variant exhibited weak to moderate free-running rhythmicity. These results confirm the assignment of LNv neurons as the principal circadian pacemakers controlling daily locomotion in Drosophila. They also implicate PDF as the principal circadian transmitter.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Subsets of murine CD4+ T cells localize to different areas of the spleen after adoptive transfer. Na&#195;&#175;ve and T helper 1 (TH1) cells, which express the chemokine receptor CCR7, are home to the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath, whereas activated TH2 cells, which lack CCR7, form rings at the periphery of the T cell zones near B cell follicles. Retroviral transduction of TH2 cells with CCR7 forces them to localize in a TH1-like pattern and inhibits their participation in B cell help in vivo but not in vitro. Thus, differential expression of chemokine receptors results in unique cellular migration patterns that are important for effective immune responses.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Linker proteins function as molecular scaffolds to localize enzymes with substrates. In B cells, B cell linker protein (BLNK) links the B cell receptor (BCR)-activated Syk kinase to the phosphoinositide and mitogen-activated kinase pathways. To examine the in vivo role of BLNK, mice deficient in BLNK were generated. B cell development in BLNK-/- mice was blocked at the transition from B220+CD43+ progenitor B to B220+CD43- precursor B cells. Only a small percentage of immunoglobulin M++ (IgM++), but not mature IgMloIgDhi, B cells were detected in the periphery. Hence, BLNK is an essential component of BCR signaling pathways and is required to promote B cell development.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Quantitative fluorescence imaging was used to study the regulation of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) number and density at neuromuscular junctions in living adult mice. At fully functional synapses, AChRs have a half-life of about 14 days. However, 2 hours after neurotransmission was blocked, the half-life of the AChRs was now less than a day; the rate was 25 times faster than before. Most of the lost receptors were not quickly replaced. Direct muscle stimulation or restoration of synaptic transmission inhibited this process. AChRs that were removed from nonfunctional synapses resided for hours in the perijunctional membrane before being locally internalized. Dispersed AChRs could also reaggregate at the junction once neurotransmission was restored. The rapid and reversible alterations in AChR density at the neuromuscular junction in vivo parallel changes thought to occur in the central nervous system at synapses undergoing potentiation and depression.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides infects one billion people worldwide. Its perienteric fluid contains an octameric haemoglobin that binds oxygen nearly 25,000 times more tightly than does human haemoglobin. Despite numerous investigations, the biological function of this molecule has remained elusive. The distal haem pocket contains a metal, oxygen and thiol, all of which are known to be reactive with nitric oxide. Here we show that Ascaris haemoglobin enzymatically consumes oxygen in a reaction driven by nitric oxide, thus keeping the perienteric fluid hypoxic. The mechanism of this reaction involves unprecedented chemistry of a haem group, a thiol and nitric oxide. We propose that Ascaris haemoglobin functions as a 'deoxygenase', using nitric oxide to detoxify oxygen. The structural and functional adaptations of Ascaris haemoglobin suggest that the molecular evolution of haemoglobin can be rationalized by its nitric oxide related functions.</p>

In CD2AP-deficient mice, immune function was compromised, but the mice died at 6 to 7 weeks of age from renal failure. In the kidney, CD2AP was expressed primarily in glomerular epithelial cells. Knockout mice exhibited defects in epithelial cell foot processes, accompanied by mesangial cell hyperplasia and extracellular matrix deposition.

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Precursors of alpha-defensin peptides require activation for bactericidal activity. In mouse small intestine, matrilysin colocalized with alpha-defensins (cryptdins) in Paneth cell granules, and in vitro it cleaved the pro segment from cryptdin precursors. Matrilysin-deficient (MAT-/-) mice lacked mature cryptdins and accumulated precursor molecules. Intestinal peptide preparations from MAT-/- mice had decreased antimicrobial activity. Orally administered bacteria survived in greater numbers and were more virulent in MAT-/- mice than in MAT+/+ mice. Thus, matrilysin functions in intestinal mucosal defense by regulating the activity of defensins, which may be a common role for this metalloproteinase in its numerous epithelial sites of expression.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>We present evidence that phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of Rb by Cdk4/6 initiates successive intramolecular interactions between the C-terminal region and the central pocket. The initial interaction displaces histone deacetylase from the pocket, blocking active transcriptional repression by Rb. This facilitates a second interaction that leads to phosphorylation of the pocket by Cdk2 and disruption of pocket structure. These intramolecular interactions provide a molecular basis for sequential phosphorylation of Rb by Cdk4/6 and Cdk2. Cdk4/6 is activated early in G1, blocking active repression by Rb. However, it is not until near the end of G1, when cyclin E is expressed and Cdk2 is activated, that Rb is prevented from binding and inactivating E2F.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Delivery of therapeutic proteins into tissues and across the blood-brain barrier is severely limited by the size and biochemical properties of the proteins. Here it is shown that intraperitoneal injection of the 120-kilodalton beta-galactosidase protein, fused to the protein transduction domain from the human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein, results in delivery of the biologically active fusion protein to all tissues in mice, including the brain. These results open new possibilities for direct delivery of proteins into patients in the context of protein therapy, as well as for epigenetic experimentation with model organisms.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The protein Bid is a participant in the pathway that leads to cell death (apoptosis), mediating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in response to signals from 'death' receptors known as TNFR1/Fas on the cell surface. It is a member of the proapoptotic Bcd-2 family and is activated as a result of its cleavage by caspase 8, one of a family of proteolytic cell-death proteins. To investigate the role of Bid in vivo, we have generated mice deficient for Bid. We find that when these mice are injected with an antibody directed against Fas, they nearly all survive, whereas wild-type mice die from hepatocellular apoptosis and haemorrhagic necrosis. About half of the Bid-deficient animals had no apparent liver injury and showed no evidence of activation of the effector caspases 3 and 7, although the initiator caspase 8 had been activated. Other Bid-deficient mice survived with only moderate damage: all three caspases (8 and 37) were activated but their cell nuclei were intact and no mitochondrial cytochrome c was released. We also investigated the effects of Bid deficiency in cultured cells treated with anti-Fas antibody (hepatocytes and thymocytes) or with TNFalpha. (fibroblasts). In these Bid-/- cells, mitochondrial dysfunction was delayed, cytochrome c was not released, effector caspase activity was reduced and the cleavage of apoptosis substrates was altered. This loss-of-function model indicates that Bid is a critical substrate in vivo for signalling by death-receptor agonists, which mediates a mitochondrial amplification loop that is essential for the apoptosis of selected cells.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Many Gram-negative pathogens assemble architecturally and functionally diverse adhesive pili on their surfaces by the chaperone-usher pathway. Immunoglobulin-like periplasmic chaperones escort pilus subunits to the usher, a large protein complex that facilitates the translocation and assembly of subunits across the outer membrane. The crystal structure of the PapD-PapK chaperone-subunit complex, determined at 2.4 angstrom resolution, reveals that the chaperone functions by donating its G(1) beta strand to complete the immunoglobulin-like fold of the subunit via a mechanism termed donor strand complementation. The structure of the PapD-PapK complex also suggests that during pilus biogenesis, every subunit completes the immunoglobulin-like fold of its neighboring subunit via a mechanism termed donor strand exchange.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The specialized junction between a T lymphocyte and an antigen-presenting cell, the immunological synapse, consists of a central cluster of T cell receptors surrounded by a ring of adhesion molecules. Immunological synapse formation is now shown to be an active and dynamic mechanism that allows T cells to distinguish potential antigenic ligands. Initially, T cell receptor ligands were engaged in an outermost ring of the nascent synapse. Transport of these complexes into the central cluster was dependent on T cell receptor-ligand interaction kinetics. Finally, formation of a stable central cluster at the heart of the synapse was a determinative event for T cell proliferation.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Thrombolysis has become established as an acute treatment for human stroke. But despite multiple clinical trials, neuroprotective strategies have yet to be proved effective in humans. Here we discuss intrinsic tissue mechanisms of ischaemic brain injury, and present a perspective that broadening of therapeutic targeting beyond excitotoxicity and neuronal calcium overload will be desirable for developing the most effective neuroprotective therapies.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Rb inhibits progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. It associates with a number of cellular proteins; however, the nature of these interactions and their relative significance in cell cycle regulation are still unclear. We present evidence that Rb must normally interact with the E2F family of transcription factors to arrest cells in G1, and that this arrest results from active transcriptional repression by the Rb-E2F complex, not from inactivation of E2F. Thus, a major role of E2F in cell cycle regulation is assembly of this repressor complex. We demonstrate that active repression by Rb-E2F mediates the G1 arrest triggered by TGFbeta, p16INK4a, and contact inhibition.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Neuronal death induced by activating N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has been linked to Ca2+ and Na+ influx through associated channels. Whole-cell recording from cultured mouse cortical neurons revealed a NMDA-evoked outward current, INMDA-K, carried by K+ efflux at membrane potentials positive to -86 millivolts. Cortical neurons exposed to NMDA in medium containing reduced Na+ and Ca2+ (as found in ischemic brain tissue) lost substantial intracellular K+ and underwent apoptosis. Both K+ loss and apoptosis were attenuated by increasing extracellular K+, even when voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were blocked. Thus NMDA receptor-mediated K+ efflux may contribute to neuronal apoptosis after brain ischemia.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>A general problem in biology is how to incorporate information about evolutionary history and adaptation into taxonomy. The problem is exemplified in attempts to define our own genus, Homo. Here conventional criteria for allocating fossil species to Homo are reviewed and are found to be either inappropriate or inoperable. We present a revised definition, based on verifiable criteria, for Homo and conclude that two species, Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis, do not belong in the genus. The earliest taxon to satisfy the criteria is Homo ergaster, or early African Homo erectus, which currently appears in the fossil record at about 1.9 million years ago.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>The olfactory bulb plays a central role in olfactory information processing through its connections with both peripheral and cortical structures. Axons projecting from the olfactory bulb to the telencephalon are guided by a repulsive activity in the septum. The molecular nature of the repellent is not known. We report here the isolation of vertebrate homologs of the Drosophila slit gene and show that Slit protein binds to the transmembrane protein Roundabout (Robo). Slit is expressed in the septum whereas Robo is expressed in the olfactory bulb. Functionally, Slit acts as a chemorepellent for olfactory bulb axons. These results establish a ligand-receptor relationship between two molecules important for neural development, suggest a role for Slit in olfactory bulb axon guidance, and reveal the existence of a new family of axon guidance molecules.</p>

    <p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span><br/>Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are required for ribose 2'-O-methylation of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA. Many of the genes for this snoRNA family have remained unidentified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, despite the availability of a complete genome sequence. Probabilistic modeling methods akin to those used in speech recognition and computational linguistics were used to computationally screen the yeast genome and identify 22 methylation guide snoRNAs, snR50 to snR71. Gene disruptions and other experimental characterization confirmed their methylation guide function. In total, 51 of the 55 ribose methylated sites in yeast ribosomal RNA were assigned to 41 different guide snoRNAs.</p>
